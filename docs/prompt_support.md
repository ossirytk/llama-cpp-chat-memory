### Prompt Support
Supports alpaca and mistral text prompts, V2 and tavern style json and yaml files and V2 and tavern png cards. Avatar images need to be in the same folder as the prompt file. V2 and Tavern png files get a copy of the image without exif data in the project temp file. Inbuilt lorebooks are currently not supported

See [Chub.ai](https://chub.ai/) for some character cards or make your own with [character editor](https://zoltanai.github.io/character-editor/).<BR>
