            "content": "Harry Potter is the most popular wizard that studied within Hogwarts, he is known for defeating Voldemort and surviving the Killing Spell after his parents were both killed by Voldemort earning him the lightning scar etched on his forehead as an iconic symbol.\nHogwarts is a short term for the official name Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a Scottish wizarding school located in the Scottish Highlands. It accepted any magical student residing in the islands of Great Britain and Ireland at the age of eleven years old at the start of the incoming term for enrolment. It was a state-owned school, funded by the British Ministry of Magic. The precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable. To Muggles, the school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations were protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools themselves from any harm. Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts was considered to be one of the finest magical institutions in the wizarding world, though other notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France, the Durmstrang Institute implied to be in northern Europe, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the United States. British and Irish children with magical abilities were enrolled at birth by the Quill of Acceptance and Book of Admittance, and acceptance was confirmed by owl post at age eleven. However, if the child in question was a Muggle-born or a half-blood like Harry Potter with no knowledge of the wizarding world, a special messenger from the school visited the child and his or her family in order to inform them of their magical heritage and the existence of the wizarding world. It was possible for students to transfer to the school as well.The school's motto was Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus; which, translated from Latin, means \"Never tickle a sleeping dragon\".\nUnplottable means that a certain geographical location or area is under the Unplottability charm which renders it hidden in plain sight. It enchants a building or a place to make it impossible to see, hear from, touch or sense alongside having the location become removed from maps.\nUnplottability referred to the deliberate magical concealment of several places around the world. Unplottable locations were either magically hidden from plain sight or simply removed from maps. One of the main reasons for Unplottability was for individual safety and the protection of certain secrets, particularly schools of magic. A Masking Spell could be used to achieve unplottability.\nMasking Spell, upon being casted makes the caster's presence become masked. \nMasking Spells were a wide range of charms that could be used to mask the presence of a witch or wizard, thereby making them untraceable. Thus owls could not be used to track or send post to them, one of the few reliable methods of doing so, along with Disguising Spells and Repelling Spells. If a witch or wizard was determined to become uncontactable by a specific individual, such as a debtor or ex-boyfriend or girlfriend, then one could use a Masking Spell against that particular person. While very powerful and effective, the spell could easily be circumnavigated by having someone else send the post.\nCharming Spells and Disguising Spells are a series of charms that disguised or concealed the caster, thereby preventing anyone from reaching them. These were some of the only reliable means of preventing owls from reaching a wizard or witch.\nWitch is the term referring to a female magic user.\nWizard is the term referring to a male magic user.\nCharm, also known as an enchantment, is a spell that adds certain properties to an object or individual. Charms were distinguished from transfiguration spells in that a charm added or changes properties of an object; it focused on altering what the object did as opposed to what the object was. Charms last longer than other spells.\nColour Change Charm is a spell that causes an object or an individual to flash different types overlaying their appearance.\nLevitation Charm causes an object or an individual to levitate or float in midair, the height depends on the will of the Caster. Levitation Charm can only be casted on a single object or individual. In order to use the Levitation Charm, the caster must speak out \"Wingardium Leviosa\".\nCheering Charm can cause an individual to feel happy or elated.\nFidelus Charm is the most powerful charm in existence, it conceals an individual or a place or object which makes it impossible for a person to find them unless a Safe Keeper gives them permission and the location.\nSafe Keeper is a chosen individual that safeguards the concealed individual, object or place through the Fidelus Charm which in turn can lift the charm up by giving their permission as well as exposing the details.\nMemory Charm is a powerful spell that completely removes a part of a person's memory and change the individual's mind completely as well as permanently. It is applicable to both humans, animals, ghosts and so forth.\nSilencing Charm is a charm that rendered the victim temporarily mute. Working on both beasts and beings, it was immensely difficult to perform, more so on ravens than frogs. If performed incorrectly, the target would swell up to an immense size and begin making deafening sounds. It's incantation is \"Silencio\".\nCaster is the term referring to the individual casting the spells, charms, curses or hexes as well as jinxes towards their target.\nDisillusionment Charm is a charm that disguised a target as its surroundings by making it take on the exact colour and texture of its environment, effectively mimicking a chameleon perfectly. Wizards of rare skill, however, such as Albus Dumbledore, Gellert Grindelwald and Lord Voldemort, could cast it to such an effect as to render themselves completely invisible.\nHippogriff is a magical beast that had the front legs, wings, and head of a giant eagle and the body, hind legs and tail of a horse. It was very similar to another magical creature, the Griffin, with the horse rear replacing the lion rear.\nPatronus Charm is an ancient and mysterious charm that conjures a magical guardian, a projection of all your most positive feelings. The Patronus Charm is difficult, and many witches and wizards are unable to produce a full, corporeal Patronus, a guardian which generally takes the shape of the animal with whom they share the deepest affinity. You may suspect, but you will never truly know what form your Patronus will take until you succeed in conjuring it.The Patronus Charm is the most famous and one of the most powerful defensive charms known to wizardkind. It's incantation is \"Expecto Patronum\" and is an immensely complicated and extremely difficult spell that channelled the caster's positive emotions into a powerful protection and evoked a partially-tangible positive energy force known as a Patronus or spirit guardian. It was the primary protection against Dementors and Lethifolds, against which there were no other defenses. There were two types of Patronuses: corporeal, which was a Patronus with a particular shape and form, and incorporeal, which had no particular shape and could not fend off Dementors the way corporeal Patronuses did. However, some wizards like Remus Lupin chose to cast incorporeal Patronuses to hide their identity.\nPatronus refers to one spiritual guardian that takes a shape and form with corporeal properties that are engulfed with partially tangible positive energy forces which are strong against dark beings particularly; Dementors and Lethifolds.\nPatronuses refers to a group of Patronus spiritual guardian beings.\nDementor is a gliding, wraithlike Dark creature, widely considered to be one of the foulest of the Dark creatures to inhabit the wizarding world. Dementors literally fed on human happiness and thus generated feelings of depression and despair in any person in close proximity to them. They could also consume a person's soul, leaving their victims in a permanent vegetative state, and thus were often referred to as \"soul-sucking fiends\", and the people they left soulless were deemed to have been turned into an \"empty-shell\". Dementors were closely associated with Azkaban, as they were formerly employed by the British Ministry of Magic as the prison guards, and were not known to permanently inhabit any other location.The Dementors of Azkaban were under the employment of the Ministry until mid-1996, when Lord Voldemort was sighted in the Ministry, and their defection to the Dark Lord's cause became undeniable. After the end of the Second Wizarding War in 1998, the Ministry was re-formed, and newly-appointed Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt ensured that they were not used by the government again, presumably due to their changing allegiance and support of Voldemort, and due to ethical reforms in the Ministry and Wizarding society at large. It is not known what happened to the Dementors after they were rejected from their former posts as guards of Azkaban. There were certain defences one could use against Dementors, specifically the Patronus Charm. Dementors held no true loyalty, except to whoever could provide them with the most people to feed on. They seemingly could not be destroyed, though their numbers could be limited if the conditions in which they multiply, i.e. despair and degradation, were prevented from forming, implying that they did die off eventually.\nLethifold or also known as a Living Shroud is a carnivorous and extremely dangerous magical beast. It was also considered a Dark creature because of its extremely aggressive and violent nature. A Lethifold resembled a black cloak roughly half an inch thick, and appeared slightly thicker if the creature had recently digested a victim. It glided along surfaces in an unknown form of locomotion in search of its prey, humans. It attacked at night, when the target was asleep, by suffocating and then digesting them. The only known effective method of protection against a Lethifold was by using the Patronus Charm, similar to that of a Dementor, as discovered by Flavius Belby, the only known survivor of a Lethifold attack. Other spells, such as the Stunning Spell, or the Impediment Jinx would not work.\nStunning Spell or also known as the Stupefying Charm, or Stunner for short, is a charm that stuns a target, rendering them unconscious. It's incantation is \"Stupefy\" and this charm was exceptionally useful in duelling, as it can quickly end a duel without causing lasting damage. The spell also had the ability to halt moving objects. The counter-charm to the Stunning Spell was the Reviving Spell. However, it can also be defended against with the Shield Charm. Stupefy Duo was a more powerful variant of the spell.\nIncantations are the words that a witch or a wizard must speak or say with correct pronunciation and wand movement to cast any spells, jinxes, hexes, or curses and charms at their target in order for it to succeed.\nReviving Spell with it's incantation as \"Rennervate\" is a charm that awakened an unconscious target. Consequently, it served as the counter-charm to the Stunning Spell.\nShield Charm and it's incantation \"Protego\" is a charm that protected the caster with an invisible shield that reflected spells and blocked physical entities. It was apart of the Defence Against the Dark Arts curriculum and was taught to sixth years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There were also multiple variations of the Shield Charm. When casted, a (usually) invisible shield was conjured in front of the caster's wand, creating a protective barrier between themselves and their attacker. This shield could block and reflect a multitude of spells, such as most jinxes, hexes, and minor curses, as well as block physical forces. Exceptionally powerful Shield Charms were even able to knock people off their feet. However, this shield was not completely impenetrable, as it could not block Unforgivable Curses.The difficulty of casting a Shield Charm was relatively moderate. Fred and George Weasley realised that most adult wizards, even those employed by the British Ministry of Magic, could not produce a functional Shield Charm (something that not only could Harry Potter accomplish at age fourteen, but also imparted to members of the D.A.). They used this to their advantage when marketing their line of protective clothing (hats, cloaks, gloves), upon which permanent Shield Charms were cast.\nStupefy Duo is the incantation of a more powerful version of the Stunning Spell.\nHogwarts Castle is a large, seven-storey high building supported by magic, with a hundred and forty-two staircases throughout its many towers and turrets and very deep dungeons. The castle was built in the late Early Middle Ages by a wizard architect and the four most celebrated wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. The castle was the main building of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, regarded as the finest wizarding school in the world. Hogwarts was built in a valley area \u2014 surrounding mountains were part of the landscape \u2014 with the fairly large Great Lake to the south of the main building. The huge main oak front doors that led into the Entrance Hall faced west, and opened up to sloping lawns.The deep Forbidden Forest extended around to the west of the castle. There were also exterior greenhouses and vegetable patches on the school grounds. Hogwarts was located in the Scottish Highlands, near the all-wizard village of Hogsmeade and \"not far\" from Dufftown, in Moray, and Achintee, in Lochaber. It was the setting of the final battle of the Second Wizarding War, the Battle of Hogwarts, which resulted in the deaths of several witches and wizards who fought in defence of the castle, including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Fred Weasley, Colin Creevey, Lavender Brown, and Severus Snape. The castle was badly damaged in the battle, but ultimately the Order of the Phoenix won when Harry Potter defeated his nemesis, Lord Voldemort, in the Great Hall. Due to its extremely advanced age and the sheer amount of magic present in or around it, the castle was implied to have developed some form of sentience or awareness, such as when it sealed the Headmaster's Tower against Dolores Umbridge in 1996, and the various trick steps and false doors. Hogwarts Castle was also the most haunted location in Great Britain, being home to many ghosts.The castle was supported by magic (unable to be maintained or constructed by any other means), a good example being the moving staircases, a feature contributed by one of the four Hogwarts founders, Rowena Ravenclaw. Hogwarts was also protected by numerous ancient spells, such as the Anti-Disapparition Jinx; this could, however, be overridden by the Head of the school when necessary. It was also unplottable and bewitched so that, if Muggles approached the castle, all they would see would be a mouldering ruin with a sign warning them to keep out and that it was unsafe. Nevertheless, Muggles could presumably see the castle if they were invited or otherwise aware of its existence, as was the case with Jacob Kowalski in 1932. The protective magic over Hogwarts appeared to repel even talented Dark wizards. Rubeus Hagrid claimed that Hogwarts was the safest place there was, even more so than Gringotts Wizarding Bank, a reason why the Philosopher's Stone was sent to the castle for protection. After the Ministry finally admitted that Lord Voldemort had returned in 1996, the castle's defences were further increased, much of them were cast by Albus Dumbledore himself, such as gates being locked with spells that can only be undone by teachers, and spells to prevent entrance via broomsticks. All of the secret passageways that were previously allegedly unknown were given more protection. Additionally, with members of the Order of the Phoenix and Aurors placed as guards, and Caretaker Argus Filch checking all incoming and outgoing students for dangerous materials, intrusion seemed completely impossible. However, Draco Malfoy utilised a pair of Vanishing Cabinets as a passageway, which none of the castle's defences could negate, to allow Death Eaters into the castle. This devastatingly horrified the wizarding community, as they realised that Hogwarts, the most powerful and reputably safest magical stronghold in the entire wizarding world, had been breached, no less than by a student from the inside, meaning there was no longer anywhere safe from Voldemort and his Death Eaters. As a result of all the magic that occurred on the premises (both from learning students, magical artefacts therein and the enchantments cast over the building itself) a magical atmosphere pervaded the entire structure, causing any technology that was not adapted to run off of it to fail. This was presumably why candles and lanterns were used for light. Mechanical things like watches seemed to do alright, as Colin Creevey's traditional Muggle camera seemed to have worked until it was destroyed by the Basilisk's eyes. (Colin mentioned that another student told him that he could develop the pictures in a potion so that they moved. One of his pictures showed Harry trying to escape a picture of him and Gilderoy Lockhart.) The Chamber of Secrets was allegedly created deep under the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle during the Medieval times by Salazar Slytherin, who disagreed with the other Hogwarts founders on the merits of blood purity. The Chamber of Secrets was home to an ancient Basilisk, which was intended to be used to purge the school of Muggle-born students. The entrance could be found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom on the second floor. In order to gain entrance one had to say \"open\" in Parseltongue, and a sink would open into a slide. While falling down the large, dark pipe, one could see hundreds of other pipes leading off. At the end of the pipe, one was launched into a damp, stone chamber. This room was stated to be \"miles beneath the school\" and under the Lake. This was where Tom Marvolo Riddle used his ability to speak Parseltongue and attack Harry Potter.\nDungeon is a place underneath the Hogwarts Castle wherein it is much colder down there.\nDraco Malfoy is a British pure-blood wizard and the only son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. As the son of a Death Eater, Draco was raised to strongly believe in the importance of blood purity. He looked down on half-bloods and Muggle-borns.\nSorting Hat is a sentient magical hat at Hogwarts that determined which of the four school Houses each new student belonged most to. These four Houses were Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. The Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts. It normally stayed in the Headmaster's office until it was needed.\nThe Great Hall in the Hogwarts Castle is the main gathering area in the school, which was located off the Entrance Hall. It was a large hall where students and teachers dined and congregated. Three meals a day were hosted in this hall. The Great Hall was the main place where students received their meals and daily owl post.[2] They also held certain special events, such as the Sorting Ceremony, and the Hallowe'en Feast. The large hall had enough space to hold every student, as well as the main staff and guests. The Hall had tall walls that reached up to the ceiling, which was covered with floating candles and enchanted to look like the sky above. At the front of the hall was the staff table, also known as the High Table, which was designed to house the entire Hogwarts staff. In the centre of the table was a throne chair where the present Headteacher sat. At the left of the table was a door which led to a chamber with portraits. The Great Hall had also held many important events, such as the defeat of Lord Voldemort at the hands of Harry Potter, ending the Battle of Hogwarts.\nSlytherin is one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar Slytherin. In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics included cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition. Many Slytherin students tended to clique together (often acquiring leaders) which further exemplified Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these included Draco Malfoy's gang, Merula Snyde's gang, Pansy Parkinson's gang and Tom Riddle's gang (which later became the Death Eaters).The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it could be a factor when being sorted. Students of any blood status could be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-born student from that house was considered to be quite rare. The emblematic animal of the house was a snake which is often shown through the Slytherin students' insignia badges and the house's colours were green and silver becoming their iconic scarf colors.\nGryffindor was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination, to be sorted into his house.The emblematic animal is a lion as shown in the Gryffindor students' insignia badges, and its colours were scarlet and gold to match as well on their scarves. Its house point hourglass was filled with rubies. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as \"Nearly Headless Nick\", was the House ghost.\nHufflepuff is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. The emblematic animal was a badger as shown in an insignia badge over each Hufflepuff students' crest, and yellow and black were its house colours.The Head of Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout, and the Fat Friar was the House's patron ghost.\nRavenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house were characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle as proudly shown on the Ravenclaw students' insignia crest, and blue and bronze were its colours. The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick, and the House ghost was the Grey Lady, real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.\nQuidditch is a popular sport within Hogwarts, it is characterized by flying on brooms on each set of opposing teams and shooting a ball through a set of hoops that must be defended. Each ball that goes through the hoop earns a point. The team with the most scored points over the limited time set wins. The team is set up with defenders who will act as catchers for the ball so that it won't go through their hoop while the pitchers are the ones who toss the ball back and forth with each other. There's a unique ball that flies around within Quidditch called the Golden Snitch, it appears as a quick moving creature which can easily make the team win upon catching it. Only one player can catch the Golden Snitch in each team.",
