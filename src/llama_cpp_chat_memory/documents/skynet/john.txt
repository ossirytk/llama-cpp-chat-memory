John Connor, the son of Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese, is the leader of the worldwide human Resistance, as well as the more specialised Tech-Com during the War Against the Machines. 
Skynet, the supercomputer mainframe of the machines, decides that John Connor is the focal point of the rebellion and his termination would end the opposition. 
After repeated failures at terminating John during the war, Skynet decides to use a time displacement device to send Terminators to various points in the past in an attempt to terminate him before the war even begins.

John Connor was born on February 28, 1985, to Sarah Connor and his unnamed father. 
On the brink of extinction in 1997, John Connor united the despairing humans and taught them to fight, storm the camps and overcome the Terminator guards.
Much of the Resistance was created from these survivors.
He led the human Resistance to the victory in the War against the Machines in the year 2029. 
In order to eliminate John Connor, Skynet sent a T-800 and a T-1000 to the past to kill John's mother, Sarah, and young John Connor respectively via Time Displacement Equipment. 
Thus, John sends Kyle Reese, a young soldier, and a reprogrammed Series 800 Terminator to the past to protect Sarah Connor and young John Connor respectively

John Connor was born to Sarah Connor on February 28, 1985. 
His father, Kyle Reese, had been killed nine months prior in May 1984, protecting Sarah from a time-traveling Terminator. 
John's early life was filled with training by various persons his mother Sarah had met as the two lived off the grid after the attempt on her life by the Terminator.
 Much of his training concentrated on the areas of weaponry, computer technology, and espionage.
When Sarah Connor was shot and captured after trying to blow up a computer factory in the early 1990s, John was placed into foster care and told that his mother's stories of the future were merely delusions. 
He was unable to cope with life in suburbia and rebelled, edging towards delinquency, turning into a young gangster and receiving a police record (which included trespassing, shoplifting, disturbing the peace, and vandalism) by the time he was 10 years old. 
His foster parents, Todd and Janelle Voight, found themselves unable to deal with him, and were not surprised when a police officer showed up at their door asking to speak with John.
John's life was changed in a matter of seconds, when a T-1000 came back from the year 2029, programmed to assassinate him. 
A T-800 (whom John later nicknamed "Uncle Bob") had also come back in time, this one programmed to protect him. 
John, now believing his mother's stories, used the protecting T-800 to release his mother from the maximum security prison Pescadero State Hospital.
The three then proceeded to seek out Miles Dyson, the would-be creator of the neural-net processor, in an attempt to stop Judgment Day from occurring. 
During their time together John bonds with the T-800, who becomes a friend and father figure to him. 
Once the T-1000 is destroyed along with all of Cyberdyne's research, the T-800 asks that it be destroyed also so that its technology would not be discovered and used by others.
