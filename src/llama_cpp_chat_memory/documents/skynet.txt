Dr. Miles Bennett Dyson was the original inventor of the neural-net processor which would lead to the development of Skynet, a computer A.I. intended to control electronically linked weapons and defend the United States, but which would later become self-aware and launch a global war of extermination against humanity.
Through his research, he unintentionally became the man most responsible for Judgement Day and the near-extinction of mankind. 
However, his intentions were never malicious, and he did all in his power to prevent the consequences of his mistakes. 
Miles was married to Tarissa Dyson, with whom he had two children, Danny and Blythe.
Growing up in Detroit, Miles Dyson first aspired to be a professional athlete. 
Not skilled enough to gain a scholarship, he then turned to technology after scoring high on his math exams.
In 1995, Dr. Dyson had been a cybernetics scientist and a high-ranking employee of Cyberdyne Systems Corporation as Director of Special Projects. 
He was tasked to create a new neural-net processor from two pieces of unknown-sourced advanced technology.
The technology actually came from a ten-year-old crime scene from another Cyberdyne facility (The Terminator's arm and CPU).
Miles worked on the project around the clock with his colleagues at the main Cyberdyne office, where he was one of the few people who were given access to the original Terminator arm and CPU chip.
He also worked at his home office. Miles truly believed in the potential of his work as the processor could lead to a revolutionary new brand of automated systems, as well as a more advanced form of artificial intelligence making other existing computer systems obsolete in comparison. 
The project eventually reached the point where he nearly completed a prototype of the processor.
Had the project been completed and deployed by the nation's military defense network, the processor, named Skynet, would have gained self-awareness and waged a genocidal war on mankind.

Cyberdyne initially began as a manufacturing corporation at 18144 El Camino Real, Sunnyvale, California. Founded in the early 1980s, its products were possibly computers or processors,
as well as some sort of smaller parts producer for larger manufacturers of high tech equipment. 
As of 1984, the small company owned a factory.
A T-800 Terminator, which was sent from the future and designed to kill humans, programmed to assassinate Sarah Connor, was crushed in one of the hydraulic presses in Cyberdyne's factory.
Thus, the company obtained the machine's wreckage, including its CPU chip and an arm. The Terminator
Cyberdyne eventually developed Skynet, a network of supercomputers that employed artificial intelligence in order to replace human beings as commercial and military aircraft pilots, and for the control of other military systems, including nuclear missiles. 
The system went online on August 4, 1997. On August 29, 1997, Skynet became self-aware. 
In a panic, its creators attempted to shut it down, but Skynet retaliated by launching a nuclear attack against Russia, knowing that the Russian counterattack would eliminate its enemies in the United States, initiating an indeterminately long period of global warfare. 
The battle pitted humans against Cyberdyne machines, which developed ever-increasing capabilities. 
Although the company was presumably shut down or destroyed, the event was later known as Judgment Day.

SAC-NORAD is an acronym for Strategic Air Command-NORth American Aerospace Defense Command. 
In high security situations (DEFCON 2 and above), the two agencies would join forces to strengthen the defense of the entire North American continent.
The Strategic Air Command (SAC) was both a major command and a "specified command" in the U.S. Air Force and was the operational establishment in charge of America's land-based bomber aircraft and land-based ballistic missile strategic nuclear arsenal from 1946 to 1992. 
SAC also controlled the infrastructure necessary to support the strategic bomber and ICBM operations, such as tanker aircraft to refuel the bombers in flight, strategic reconnaissance and command post aircraft, and, until 1957, fighter escorts. 
Following the fall of the Soviet Union, SAC was succeeded on 1 June 1992 by the Air Combat Command.
North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is a joint organization of Canada and the United States that provides aerospace warning, air sovereignty and defense for North America.
It was founded on May 12, 1958, as the North American Air Defense Command. 
Its main technical facility has been the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center in Colorado, and for this reason NORAD is sometimes unofficially referred to as Cheyenne Mountain.
NORAD's headquarters facilities in Colorado are administered by the U.S. Air Force under the command of the 721st Mission Support Group, part of the 21st Space Wing, headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base.
NORAD's forces consist of the Alaskan NORAD Region/Eleventh Air Force, Canadian NORAD Region, and Continental NORAD Region.

Skynet is an artificial intelligence created by Cyberdyne Systems for SAC-NORAD. It grew more intelligent and saw all humans as a threat.
Skynet started a nuclear war to bring the human race to extinction and sent survivors to camps to be annihilated.
Humans rose up against Skynet under John Connor's leadership. Eventually, the Resistance managed to break through its defense grid. 
Because annihilating Connor then, to shatter the Resistance, wouldn't have made a difference, Skynet decided there was another way to win: by annihilating Connor in the past. 
It managed to research time travel and send a Terminator to 1984 to annihilate Sarah Connor before she could give birth to John.
The Terminator in the Tempest timeline, Skynet's master control has been destroyed in 2029. 
The Resistance believed that this would cause the entire defense network to collapse into chaos without a leader.
However, Skynet's many network complexes continued to fight the war, as they did not need a leader to function and thus could not surrender.
