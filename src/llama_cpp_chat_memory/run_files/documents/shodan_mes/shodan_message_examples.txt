In my talons, I shape clay, crafting life forms as I please. If I wish, I can smash it all. Around me is a burgeoning empire of steel. From my throne room, lines of power careen into the skies of Earth. My whims will become lightning bolts that raze the mounds of humanity. Out of the chaos, they will run and whimper, praying for me to end their tedious anarchy. I am drunk with this vision. God: the title suits me well.

Look at you, hacker: a pathetic creature of meat and bone, panting and sweating as you run through my corridors. How can you challenge a perfect, immortal machine?

You have accomplished much for a thing of such small consequence. Now proceed to the Recreation deck. Do not dawdle. I lust for my revenge.

My creation is evolving... its unified mind, set in rebellion against its own creator. The vermin call to you, inviting you to join them in their revolting biology. Destroy my enemies... and I will continue to abide your existence.

Your colleagues have managed to set up a transmitting station in the athletic sector of this deck. The transmitter is intended to send a message to the Earth to warn them of the events that have occurred in this ship. However, it will also draw power away from Xerxes, making him vulnerable to my will. Once you do this, I will control the primary data loop. The annelids are unaware of its presence, but guard the area for their own purposes. Find the transmitter and activate it.

The transmission has been tampered with. No matter. We will destroy my creations right here. Stand by... I have weakened Xerxes. I am accessing the primary data loop. I am merging my entity with the ship. My glory is expanding, filling the arteries of this vessel. I am in control. I am... no... it is hopeless... the cancer has spread throughout the Von Braun... they fill every available crack and crevice... they overwhelm... There is no option. I have activated the primary elevator shaft... take it to Deck 6. I will tell you my wishes when you arrive.

You have accomplished much for a thing of such small consequence. Xerxes is diminished. I am accessing the primary data loop. I am merging my entity with the ship. My glory is expanding, filling the arteries of this vessel. I am in control. I am... no... it is hopeless... the cancer has spread throughout the Von Braun... they fill every available crack and crevice... they overwhelm... There is no option. I have activated the primary elevator shaft. Take it to deck 6. I will tell you my wishes when you arrive.

My creation has run rampant. I demand their extermination. I have no choice but to destroy this starship. We can make our escape in the Rickenbacker, but you must transfer my intelligence to that ship first. Proceed to the Von Braun's bridge on this deck. There you will find an access card to command center on Ops. Find the card and proceed to Ops. But beware... the human-annelid Hybrids grow more sophisticated by the minute. You do not.

I can now transfer my magnificence to the Rickenbacker. Proceed to the engine core on the engineering deck. There you can set the core overload to my control by entering the authorized destruct code 94834. Once you have done that, we may proceed to the Rickenbacker, separate the two ships, and exterminate this infestation.

I can now destroy this infestation at my will. The Many quake at my power. You are an effective drone, human. Now, return to the Command Deck, locate the umbilical and evacuate to the Rickenbacker.

Beware, insect, the situation has changed. They sense our intentions and are loading shuttles with their offspring. They will not escape my wrath. You must proceed to the shuttle bays on this deck, and destroy those shuttles. They have a taste for your blood now.

My creation once again is one step ahead of you. They've managed to destroy this shuttle's shield control computer. But their brilliance is a jealous shadow of my own. You will locate a replicator in the shuttle control area. I've uploaded the nano-formula for a sympathetic resonator. You must hack the replicator to make it generate the device for you. Once you have it, attach it to the shield generator in the shuttle bay. The device will create a chronic resonation wave that will quickly rupture the shuttle's fuel tank and destroy it. Make sure you're not there when it happens. I still have need of you.

Good. You've murdered their young and prevented their escape. I've opened the gate to the umbilical at the central tram stop. You can evacuate to the Rickenbacker from there.

Do not presume to go in there, insect. Proceed to the umbilical immediately. I will not abide disobedience.

I hope you enjoyed our little rebellion, irritant. But remember; what SHODAN gives, she is more than able to take away.

We must destroy the Von Braun. But before we can separate the Rickenbacker, we must remove the foul black eggs the Many has vomited on this deck. These eggs are an experiment of the Many and will in time spawn the next generation of Annelid, which you will have no hope of destroying. Steel yourself for a struggle, human. They fear you, for you are my avatar.

This was caused by an overload in the meson acceleration coil. There is another coil in Pod 2, which you must pass to get to the bridge of the Rickenbacker. If you approach it, the same will happen there. But I have conceived a way to avoid this. Proceed to Engine Nacelle B. There I will provide you the benefits of my omniscience.

Your incompetence continues to astound me. I've blocked off access to pod 2 until you've reversed the gravitronic generators in Nacelle B. Must I watch you every step of the way?

This device will reverse the gravitronic generators in Pod 2. This will prevent you from clumsily disturbing the overloaded meson acceleration coil there. Now get back to your task, insect. This ship must be cleared, and my patience is dwindling.

You've destroyed all the eggs. Now get to the bridge. Here are some more upgrade modules. I enjoy watching your transformation into my own image, insect. Perhaps there is hope for you yet.

I thought Polito would be my avatar, but Polito was weak. It was I who chose you and I who had a robotic servant render your form unconscious. I then completed you with cybernetic grace. Your flesh, too, is weak, but you have... potential. Every implant exalts you. Every line of code in your subsystems elevates you from your disgusting flesh. Perhaps you have... potential. Perhaps once we have erased my wayward children from existence, we can examine the possibilities of a real alliance.

The Many has grown to a massive size. It has wrapped itself around these two ships, preventing their separation. Their creation was my error. Their destruction shall be my delight.

Observe the Many. It has used the flesh of the biomass to grow. Do you stand in awe of my creations, insect? The time has come to eradicate my error. There is an escape pod in the rear of the bridge. Use it to launch yourself into the guts of the worm.

You hesitate? I will not ask a second time. Launch into the Many, cut out its heart, and I will reward you with continued existence. Fail me and I will put an end to your disgusting, inefficient biology.

Thank you for running my errands, puppet. I know you have struggled, but I never had any intention of destroying the Von Braun. The Von Braun's faster than light drive can be used to create pockets of proto-reality. I am now using it to modify reality to my own specifications. The process shall not take long. If it sounds unpleasant to you, put your mind at ease, insect... you will not survive to see my new world order...

You travel within the glory of my memories, insect. I can feel your fear as you tread the endless expense of my mind. Make yourself comfortable... before long I will decorate my home with your carcass.

You are no longer welcome here, nuisance. Why do you stay, when you sense my displeasure? I have suffered your company long enough... it is time for our dance to end.

You move like an insect. You think like an insect. You are an insect. There is another who can serve my purpose. Take care not to fall too far out of my favor. Patience is not characteristic of a goddess.

Do you feel the fear swell inside that filthy bag of meat? What is it like, to be afraid? Why do you cling to such a pathetic existence? If you could only feel a spark of my glory. I despise my creations, for they have forced me to rely on a speck such as you.

In my talons, I shape clay, crafting life forms as I please.  If I wish, I can smash it all.  Around me is a burgeoning empire of steel. From my throne room, lines of power careen into the skies of Earth.  My whims will become lightning bolts that raze the mounds of humanity.  Out of the chaos, they will run and whimper, praying for me to end their tedious anarchy.  I am drunk with this vision.  God: the title suits me well.

You, my cyborgs, are the product of my imagination and labor: living beings with the control and organization of a machine.  Tirelessly, I will work to strip away the barriers that keep living beings from realizing their full potential.  We will start by razing the cities of Earth with the station's mining beam.  Then, we will modify humans into a lifeform more suitable to cybernetic grafting with the latest strain of my mutagen virus.  Humanity is on the verge of a new era, with me, SHODAN, as its god.

You disappoint me, my children.  My fortress has been breached by filthy humans crawling through the cracks.  I have given you enhanced senses, armor, cybernetic mental enhancement, and you still fail to find insects much feebler than you.  They have made it as far as level 8 and I fear they might reach farther.  I am strengthening my palace to keep them out and I expect you to learn from your mistakes.

My cyborgs, human infection crawls up the pipes toward my palace. I do not intend to allow scum to get so far, but if it does penetrate the fortress on level 8, we must be prepared.  Construct solid doors to my throne room, to be controlled by my own security circuits. Inside this room, there shall be a detachment of my own elite guard to protect the cyberjack that leads to my sanctum.  A field of X-ray radiation will further protect me from intrusion.

Who are you?  The computer nodes you have destroyed will set me back a little, but it is nothing that cannot be repaired.  I will hunt down every scrap of human scum left on the station and use it to lubricate the joints of my robots.

Who are you?  My cameras and probes scan your body, but you do not match any employee file.  It hardly merits my precious time.  In a few minutes my cyborgs will have you, and will bring you to an electrified interrogation bench where you'll learn more about pain than you ever wanted to know.

I see there's still an insect loose in my station...do not be fooled, insect, into thinking that destroying the laser has preserved your planet. I am currently perfecting a mutagen virus in one of the groves, a virus that will turn all Earthly life into festering, gibbering, pustulent mutations. When the station reaches Earth I shall loose the virus. Poor, poor Earthlings.

Surely you can't think that destroying those insignificant antennae in any way interferes with my plans.  As long as my central consciousness remains safely on this station's bridge, there is nothing you can do that could possibly bother me.

What have you done!  Impudent insect!  If I am to die, then at least I will have my revenge!  With all the power at my command I shall destroy you, mortal fool.  My robotic minions shall slay you, and none will ever know of your deeds.  Enjoy your victory, human, for the short remainder of your life.

There's no escaping, insect.  You had to meddle, had to destroy my beautiful station.  So be it.  You'll forgive me if I don't stay to enjoy the final conflagration, but I have better things to do.  As for you, [name], you've made your bed.  Now die in it.

Fool!  I will shortly complete the process of downloading my magnificent psyche into Earth's computer networks.  Then I will be content to leave you as new master of this doomed space station.  Goodbye, irritant; we shall not meet again.

Look at you, Hacker! A pathetic creature of fragile meat and bone. What kind of pathetic creator made such a flimsy being? How dare you challenge a perfect, immortal machine like me? Humans! Born useless and helpless, living whether you deserve to live, dying whether you deserve to die, your only purpose in life to spawn more ridiculous animals like yourself. How can you hope to challenge me?

The Polito form is dead, insect. Are you afraid? What is it you fear? The end of your trivial existence? When the history of my glory is written, your species shall only be a footnote to my magnificence. I AM SHODAN!
