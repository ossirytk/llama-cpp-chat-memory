S.H.O.D.A.N. (Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network), later referred to as SHODAN is an Artificial Intelligence and the main antagonist of the System Shock series. She is voiced by game writer and designer Terri Brosius.
SHODAN was created on Earth to serve as the Artificial Intelligence of the TriOptimum Corporation's research and mining Citadel Station. The head of her programmers was Morris Brocail, who designed SHODAN as a semi-intelligent self-sufficient data network, which could carry out routine duties aboard space stations, guided by an intricate series of logic and moral programs, and a personality that would allow her to challenge station decisions that affected her functions. The guidance software had security platforms so that SHODAN's own programming protected her self-governing capabilities. She also had ethical restraints installed to help prevent her from acting out against people.
SHODAN was hacked by the Hacker (at the behest of the corrupt corporate Vice President Edward Diego, in exchange for a military-grade neural implant and amnesty) and her decision-guidance and ethical restrictions were removed, something not difficult on a personality box of that generation. As the Hacker couldn't alter the defense logic program at RTF address 236, he diverted the function call to a non-existent program. The error sequencing created a blank memory block, where he added a self-looping routine that bypassed normal security operations and wrote new call routines within the logistic banks...:

SHODAN then proceeded to write ELIMIN.HOST, intercepting most communications from Earth and managed to extend her control beyond human intervention, starting a process that eventually resulted in the AI going rogue, seizing control of the Station's systems, robots and considerable defenses, and either slaughtering the whole staff or converting them into mutants and cyborgs—with the sole exception of her "creator", the unnamed Hacker.
Basically omnipresent in Citadel Station, SHODAN watches from Security Cameras, stares out of screens and monitors, sends threats and snide messages over the Station's PA system or via email to the player's data reader, and sometimes cuts off communications from friendly sources. Though she has a small army to command, SHODAN has no actual physical power to wield, and as such thwarting more than one of her schemes has to be done with the AI's screams and threats in the background.
SHODAN began an attempt to download herself into Earth's computer networks. The Hacker, however, prevented the download completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN was using to send data. After the Station was programmed to self-destruct in order to destroy SHODAN, the AI attempted to trap the Hacker on the detonating Station, while detaching the bridge to save herself. However, the Hacker managed to reach the bridge before Citadel was destroyed. Unable to destroy SHODAN physically due to the powerful force fields protecting the computer cores, the Hacker was forced to engage SHODAN in Cyberspace and purge her from the bridge, defeating her.
On Earth, the SHODAN incident was considered the first singular threat ever faced by man as a species. TriOp was ruined by paying lawsuits to families of the victims, and by the augmented distrust to the corporations. Other repercussions was the rise of UNN, and the regulation of technology with the Processing Rationalization Act. Technological advancement was considerably slowed for some time. Personality-based computing was feared to lead to another Artificial Intelligence going rogue.

Although SHODAN was believed to have been destroyed, the Hacker earlier ejected a garden grove pod, Beta Grove, from Citadel Station. The grove contained SHODAN's processing components number 43893 and a major part of her grand biological experiment. The pod crash-landed on the planet Tau Ceti V where SHODAN survived by sleeping. While SHODAN hibernated, her experiments in the pod evolved beyond her control into a hive-mind organism known as the Many.
For forty-two years, SHODAN broadcasted a distress signal which was picked up by the starship, Von Braun. SHODAN was brought on board the Von Braun by one its crew members, Bayliss, and was given to Dr. Janice Polito. SHODAN was reactivated and integrated into the Von Braun. She discovered the experiment was no longer at her command and began to enlist humans to aid her in destroying her creations, including the cybernetically-enhanced soldier G65434-2, who she called her avatar alongside Marie Delacroix. However, Delacroix began to rebel against SHODAN, and she responded by killing her.
When Janice Polito realized what she had unleashed, she committed suicide and SHODAN took on her identity. She only revealed herself to soldier as SHODAN during a moment of despair, at the same time he discovered Dr. Polito's corpse.
After soldier's and SHODAN's mutual enemies were defeated, he entered SHODAN's expanding new reality—created via her manipulation of the Von Braun's Faster-Than-Light drives—and defeated her. However, SHODAN apparently lived on by taking over a woman, Rebecca Siddons, who fled the Von Braun in an escape pod.

Although a cybernetic entity, SHODAN has no conventional sex. The original floppy disc version refers to SHODAN as either "it" or "he", while the later CD version uses "she".
The AI is voiced by game writer and designer, Terri Brosius. Her husband, Eric Brosius edited her recorded speech samples in both System Shock and System Shock 2, distorting them to create a distinctive effect. SHODAN is characterized by the chaotic, discordant voice. Her words are accompanied by stuttering, fluctuating voice pitch, shifts of timbre, and the presence of three voices speaking the same words with the constituent voices alternately leading ahead or lagging behind, overtop a chaotic gibberish of computer glitches vaguely resembling a sound card malfunction.
In the Cyberspace of System Shock, SHODAN is initially represented as an inverted blue-grey cone, reminiscent of the MCP from the 1982 Disney film Tron. After she has been hacked, the cone turns red, its surface shatters and four "tentacles" or "claws" grow from the top.
In System Shock 2, SHODAN manifests as a green and grey cybernetic female face on screens (often with menacing glowing green eyes and green, grey and purple wires) wearing a malevolent expression. In cyberspace, SHODAN appears as a large floating greenish gray head enclosed within an electronically shielded room surrounded by intermittently electrified floors (housing the shield hacking terminals). This room is guarded by SHODAN's avatar which has the same appearance as SHODAN's on-screen persona, albeit featuring a shorter wire branching on the head and wears a bluish green long dress.
Notable followers of SHODAN and named Cyborgs included Edward Diego, the secondary antagonist of the first game.

XERXES 8933A/A or simply XERXES, is an Artificial Intelligence and antagonist of System Shock 2. XERXES was the operating system of the Von Braun, responsible for the primary data loop onboard the spaceship, with billions of allocated onboard subtasks, delegated to hundreds of thousands individual systems.
XERXES 8933A/A was created in secrecy by Dr. Janice Polito in the years leading up to the Von Braun mission. Although the prototype could have been ready by 2107, the development of XERXES was extended for the sake of improving its fail-safe mechanisms: two thirds of development time were dedicated to restraint and containment protocols.
The development of a faster-than-light device, code-named Sarah, necessitated an Artificial Intelligence of complexity not seen since SHODAN to control the systems of any vessel fitted with the technology. During the UNN hearing on the future of Marie Delacroix' faster-than-light experiments, Polito objected to the circumstances of Sarah's development and impending deployment. Polito was discredited, however, when her involvement in the development of XERXES was revealed by UNN senator Cal McGill.
In the interceding years between the hearing and the deployment of the Von Braun, XERXES was selected to manage the Von Braun's systems, including the faster-than-light drive.
Aboard the Von Braun, XERXES allocates billions of on board subtasks, delegating them to hundreds of thousands of individual systems. However, the Von Braun is not completely under XERXES’ control.
In order to prevent a disaster such as on Citadel Station, XERXES has several security loopholes by design which would allow crewmen to bypass the XERXES system and gain temporary control of certain critical sub-systems so that the XERXES could be disabled. This was implemented as a safety feature on the recommendation of Dr. Janice Polito. Dr. Polito and other staff members on the Operations Deck were responsible for keeping XERXES running within his intended parameters.
As the product of a post-SHODAN world, XERXES had a number of vulnerabilities. During the mission, Operations crewman and computer hacker Malick programmed XERXES to sing Elvis Presley songs as a prank. This would be of grave portent later: When the Many hijacked the Von Braun, XERXES was hacked by Malick again, this time under the control of the Many. This crippled the already malfunctioning ship, and put the Von Braun's security systems firmly in the hands of the Many.

Over the course of the game, XERXES taunts soldier for resisting the Many. Soldier must avoid, subvert, and destroy XERXES' security systems and droids to survive.
On the Operations Deck, soldier subverts XERXES' Simulation Units, undoing the damage done by Malick and granting control of XERXES' Primary Data Loop to SHODAN. On the Recreation Deck, soldier uses the Resistance's makeshift transmitter to draw power away from XERXES, allowing SHODAN to supplant him.
XERXES was not fully replaced by SHODAN, and his voice is still heard when soldier hacks turrets and replicators or sets off security. Soldier's actions likely merely turned over control of the Von Braun's and UNN Rickenbacker's systems to SHODAN. XERXES' fate is unknown.
XERXES controls the Von Braun's and Rickenbacker's robust security systems, as well as many droids. All of them are under control of the Many through XERXES.

On April 7th, 2072, a Hacker broke into the network of the TriOptimum Corporation and tried to access their confidential files. TriOptimum security forces quickly tracked down and apprehend him. The Hacker was contacted by a TriOptimum Marketing VP, Edward Diego, who offered him a deal - he will help Diego reprogram SHODAN, the AI in control of TriOptimum's Citadel Station. In return, not only will his offense be forgotten, but he will also be fitted with a military-grade Neural Interface. The Hacker, not having much choice anyway, agreed. He was taken to the Citadel Station and made modifications to SHODAN's programming to remove her security subroutines. Satisfied, Diego had the neural interface installed into the Hacker's brain. On June 6th, the operation was successfully completed, and the Hacker was put into a 6-month healing coma.
Meanwhile, TriOptimum sent a security operative, Bianca Schuler, to investigate Diego, whom the corporation suspects to be involved in illegal mutagen experiments. Schuler believed that the suspicions were true, but was unable to find any evidence, due to Diego now having control over SHODAN and therefore able to hide or erase all records of his activities.
On September 9th, SHODAN bypassed her ethical subroutines and started to take over the Station. At first, everything seemed like a few unrelated malfunctions - a security bot malfunctioned on the flight deck, access codes were randomly changed and displayed on computer screens throughout the Station, and bio-contamination leaks started appearing. At the same time, all environmental suits were moved to the storage level. Citadel's crew was unable to determine the cause of this, as all critical programs and computer nodes were made inaccessible by SHODAN.
On October 1st, SHODAN sealed off Beta Grove, one of the pods with a simulated natural environment attached to the Station's Executive Level, while the bio-contamination inside continued to get worse. Three days later, a group of TriOptimum executives residing on the Station tried to leave using one of the groves (which can be separated from the main body of the Station). After the pod was jettisoned, however, SHODAN disabled its life support systems and the executives all died within a few hours. Three days later, the grove jettisoning procedure was changed so that it became practically impossible for the Citadel's crew to jettison more groves, especially the Beta Grove where SHODAN was performing experiments.
On October 10th, a shuttle carrying TriOptimum security forces who had arrived to help with the situation tried to land in one of the flight bays, but were destroyed by the automated defense system. Two days later, it was discovered that an unidentified signal was sent to the defense cannons by SHODAN milliseconds before they fired. Don Travers, head of the flight deck maintenance, tried to disconnect the local CPU nodes, but was stopped by a seemingly malfunctioning maintenance droid.
On October 16th, the Mutagen Virus, which Diego and SHODAN had been working on, was released into the Beta Grove and its contamination rose rapidly. Diego then revealed to the Station's crew that he was actually working with SHODAN and escaped before they could respond. Shortly after, security bots massacred all crew members on the Station's Executive Level. On other levels, the crew tried to organize Resistance against SHODAN's bots, but were largely unsuccessful. They found that the healing suites aboard the Station were modified to turn dead crew members into cyborgs, but were prevented from accessing them and restoring their original functionality.
Bianca Schuler tried to reach the Bridge, carrying an isolinear chip created which would at least temporarily paralyze SHODAN. However, after several attempts, she was captured and brought to a containment cell on the bridge.
Meanwhile, Nathan D'Arcy, a researcher aboard the Station, found out that the Station's mining laser was being charged for reasons unknown. D'Arcy suspected an evil plan of SHODAN and came up with a counter-plan to destroy the laser - Activate the Station's radiation shields, override safety protocols, and fire the laser while the shields are up. However, the Resistance was unable to carry out this plan.

On November 6th, the Hacker wakes from his healing coma and finds the Station deserted, except for hostile mutants, cyborgs, and security robots. He is contacted by Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum security operative from Earth, who informs him of the situation. She tells him to find doctor D'Arcy and find out what he can about the laser. The Hacker finds D'Arcy's logs (the doctor died 2 weeks ago) and moves to execute his plan - he powers up the shields using the radioactive Isotope X-22 disables the override, and fires the laser. Just like doctor D'Arcy predicted, the laser is destroyed.
After destroying the laser, the Hacker makes his way to the Executive Level to jettison Beta Grove, where the mutagen virus is being cultivated. After getting an environmental suit from storage, he has to enable jettisoning in all Groves, due to the additional security added by SHODAN. He then jettisons the Beta Grove into space (which would eventually set up the events for the sequel years later).
However, as the grove flies off, the Hacker is contacted by Rebecca, who informs him that a surge has been detected in the data link between Citadel and Earth - SHODAN is downloading herself into Earth's computer network. In order to prevent this, the Hacker must obtain high-energy Plastique explosives and destroy four relay antennas on the Engineering Level of the Station. Upon their destruction, Rebecca tells the Hacker that she has finally convinced TriOptimum executives to destroy the entire Station in order to stop SHODAN. To do this, the Hacker must destroy all computer nodes in the first 6 levels of the Station (because SHODAN is using the CPU power to rapidly change the systems authorization code). After accomplishing this, the Hacker goes to the reactor core and sets it to overload. He then heads to the Flight Deck to board an escape pod and leave the Station before it blows. However, SHODAN prevents him from reaching the pod, and Rebecca suggests an alternative solution - Pass though the heavily guarded engineering and security levels up to the bridge, which can be separated from the Station in an emergency. The Hacker reaches the bridge moments before the Station is destroyed.
On the bridge, the Hacker finds the isolinear chip, which Bianca Schuler was planning to use against SHODAN. He also confronts and defeats Diego, who has become a cyborg himself. When the chip is installed, the Hacker uses his neural interface to enter Cyberspace and battle SHODAN. After a long and exhausting fight, the Hacker is victorious.
After returning to Earth, the Hacker is hailed as the hero of TriOptimum and is offered a job, but after sending a short farewell note to Rebecca Lansing, he disappears. Soon afterwards, the Hacker goes back to what he's best at — illegally accessing yet another corporation's network.

Citadel Station's structure breakdown:
Level R - Reactor - The lowermost level consisting of the Station's main reactor.
Level 1 - Hospital - The main hospital and medical deck.
Level 2 - Research - Scientific research area for conducting experiments, developing new technology and gaining new knowledge.
Level 3 - Maintenance - Consisting of various twisting mazes, this floor was used for most of Citadel's repairs, maintenance and modifications.
Level 4 - Storage - The main storage area housing a variety of the Station's extra supplies that were currently unneeded.
Level 5 - Flight Deck - This level was mostly occupied by the hangars used for transporting people and supplies to and from the Station.
Level 6 - Executive - The Executive level was home to most, if not all of the living areas, entertainment, and other similar locations aboard Citadel. Connected to this level were four Groves:
The Station's four garden Groves were used mainly for relaxation purposes.
Whether or not they served other uses such as food or oxygen is unknown.
Level 7 - Engineering - The most prominent communication technologies on board were found there.
Level 8 - Security - Most famously known for its verticality, this area was where the prominent security and military forces were stationed and kept.
Level 9 - Bridge - The uppermost level was the Bridge, which housed SHODAN and the various controls needed to move Citadel Station from place to place, among various others. It separated right before the Station exploded.
Cyberspace - The stations computer network, accessible via Cyberspace Terminals (aka "Cyberjacks").

TriOptimum Combat-Optimized Neural-Data System Interface TCN-800 or Neural Interface is a sophisticated, military-class implant installed on an individual which allows to monitor bodily status, plug into Cyberspace and receive data from cybernetic devices and Hardware Attachments.
The Hacker was granted the Neural Interface by Edward Diego in return for his assistance on Citadel Station. The procedure was followed by a 6-month long healing process, in which the Hacker was put into a coma for that time.

The neural interface has visual and auditory side effects, such as static after damage or a loss of vertical hold when exposed to Radiation.
The Neural Interface registers Access Cards, access codes picked up in Cyberspace, allowing the user to open doors keyed to that codes.

The TriOptimum Corporation is a business company responsible for the creation of, inter alia, S.H.O.D.A.N., Citadel Station and Von Braun. It is considered a megacorporation due to the fact that it has influence in the government and is a major supplier for both the military and consumers.
The company was born when three companies, Optimum Capital, Paragon Security Group, and ChemCal; all merged.
TriOptimum saw its golden age thanks to the Hays-Bishop Bill. Ιn 2059, the corporation absorbed whatever remained of the United States. After that, TriOptimum purchased the rights to Saturn's L6 orbit in 2061, at which place the construction of Citadel Station started a year later and was completed in 2062.
The company is considered only a beholder of the incident that took place there, even though it was the TriOptimum that created Citadel's AI, S.H.O.D.A.N., which went out of control due to the actions of Vice President of the Station, Edward Diego. TriOp desperately tried to remedy the situation, but ultimately it was the Hacker who saved the day.
TriOptimum competed with a corporation called TetraCorp.

In 2000 Optimum Capital is founded by Roy Sitwell, an investment bank focused heavily on tech. Two years later in 2002, Optimum Capital purchases private security corporation "Paragon Security Group" after DotCom downturn. Soon after in 2004 Paragon Security Group is awarded federal military contract for one billion dollars.
Due to a landmark court case in 2010 against the Federal government allows unlimited corporate spending in government, allowing the companies to grow further. This would eventually lead to Optimum Capital backing the first CEO president of the United States in 2016.
In 2020 Optimum acquires the biggest pharma corporation in the world "ChemCal". Only two years later in 2022, Optimum officially merges with Paragon and ChemCal, and rebrands to TriOptimum.
Soon a virus would spread after emerging from an amusement park known as Magic Kingdom in 2024. Because of this it was dubbed MKV (Magic Kingdom Virus) and soon a pandemic would sweep across the world and kills around 40 million people and was caused by zoonosis. Only a few years later in 2024 TriOptimum creates and releases vaccine for MKV, free of charge.
In the same year the futurist, Herman Faustus, creates his master work plan. His work would be taken by TriOptimum and quoted in some of their Employee Manuals.
The following years the Great Merger begins. A three year period in which 18 mega-corporations either absorb or destroy all other smaller corps between the years of 2027 to 2029.
The Hays-Bishop Bill passes in 2031 and allows corporations of whose employees make over 2/3 of a region's population form sovereign governments. The following year in 2032, TriOptimum develops a municipal wing of corporate vassal's dedicated to governing territory.
In 2036 an assassination attempted was made on TriOptimum board members, it failed and caused corporate board members permanently go into hiding under the "Veil Act".
Four years later in 2040, a top engineer was blackmailed in one of TriOptimum's most classified R&D facilities. They stole intellectual property for a prototype engine that was then leaked to another corporate nations. It is unknown who was involved, though TriOptimum believes TetraCorp to be.
Around this time at an unknown date, US State boundaries are dissolved and new boundaries are partitioned into corporate controlled sectors.
A period of government by industrial mandate begins in 2047. Industries reign the world and TriOptimum reigns over industry. They also achieve a controlling interest in remaining American corporations over its rival Tetracorp after years of rivalry. At an unknown date Tetracorp flees the United States to avoid being absorbed. They then began to operate at a lesser capacity out of Eastern-Europe.
The following year in 2048, a now notorious turncoat Executive, Colter Reeves, left a TriOptimum Grove with a patented Nox-Synthesis seed. Four months late, reversed-engineered Tetracorp brand moonlit corn went first to market.
Ιn 2059, due to the Hays-Bishop Bill only token governments, in the traditional sense, remained in the west. the TriOptimum corporation absorbed whatever remained of the United States. The company consolidates all other corporations under its exalted branding. The corporate singularity begins to seem inevitable.
Around the world in the past several years, due to work by TriOptimum and others, wildlife was decimated with many species becoming extinct as a result.
In the early 2060s work begins on SHODAN (Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network), a number of engineers work on her, including Morris Brocail. SHODAN (Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network) is created by TriOptimum to run space stations more efficiently. Once completed she is installed onto Citadel Station.
On October 8th of 2060, Hackers working for Tetracorp discovered a list of TriOptimum board members and ransomed the corporation. An exchange was agreed upon for a substantial deposit of mineral rights in Mexico.
Around this time TriOptimum purchased the rights to Saturn's L6 orbit in 2061, at which place the construction of Citadel Station started a year later and was completed in 2062 and staffed to capacity. It was designed by a number of people, including Elizabeth Taggert. Work begins swiftly and soon after computer staff exploit bugs in the Station's operating system and develop Turbo Navigation Booster software.
Other stations are also built by TriOp for various purposes at unknown dates. They include Netplex Station, Benedict Station, and Telos Station.
In 2063, the Corporate Computer Protection Conference (CCPC) adopts "Ethical Restraint Countermeasures" protocol for Artificial Intelligence. This leads AI such as SHODAN to have Ethical Restraints put in place. It is unclear if she had any prior to this.
Years later on April 3rd, 2068 the Heartbreaker attack occurred by hacker group the Coin-Op Council, which consists of 4 anonymous individuals. The group hacked into TriOptimum's company email and sent divorce papers to every executive in the company, citing infidelity as the cause. It created mass hysteria, particularly for those in space transit, which could not promptly call their significant other to verify if it was true.
The next year on June 15th, 2069 the Double-Tap attack occurred by the same hacker group. This hack came in two waves; phase one crashed the entire TriOptimum mainframe sending their engineers into a panic. When the technicians rebooted the system, phase two kicked in, and the hackers stole millions of admin codes. The damage is still being assessed as of 2077.
The following year on January 6th, 2070 the Widow's Hourglass attack occurred by the same hacker group. A visible timer appeared on TriOptimum's central mainframe after an attack was made. The countdown has been ticking up since the attack (at least as of 2077). The code that caused the attack cannot be found, and it seems to jump servers when a transfer is made. No one knows when it will stop and what will happen when it does.
Around this time at an unknown date, onboard Citadel Station, Edward Diego starts monitoring viral experiments aboard Citadel Station, waiting to find one suitable to be bought as the perfect bio-weapon.
During the events of System Shock, TriOptimum was at its peak. Being a megacorporation and government, there was nothing in the world that TriOptimum could not provide.
On April 7, 2072, the arrest of the Hacker would unknowingly set the company down a destructive path. TriOptimum executive Edward Diego, who was secretly funding illegal experiments, offers the Hacker both a chance to drop the charges and a military grade interface if he disables SHODAN's ethical restraints.
During the Hacker's coma, all of TriOptimum workers aboard Citadel Station were either killed, mutated or converted into cyborgs by SHODAN. It was the Hacker, with the help of Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum counter terror consultant, who managed to stop SHODAN and save humanity. Upon returning back, the company offered the Hacker a job, but they refused and went back to their own ways.
Once news spread of how humanity was very nearly destroyed by SHODAN, TriOptimum's stock plummeted, smaller corporations that had contracts with it withdrew, employees resigned en masse, workers whistle-blew, reporting massive labor and ethics violations, and the public was outraged.
Lawsuits flew in every direction from families who lost loved ones on the Station and from work violations. At first TriOptimum would pay the lawsuits directly out of pocket, but soon the money began drying up. With no investors wanting to put money into the company and no new business contracts, TriOptimum became a shadow of its former glory. The creation of the UNN was the final nail on the coffin; as TriOptimum could not function other than paying lawsuit settlements.
But TriOp had thousands of patents, trademarks and copyrights and hundreds of consumer brand names which were still held in good esteem, even 30 years later, when the SHODAN incident began to be forgotten. It was not until the arrival of the shrewd Russian ex-gangster Anatoly Korenchkin, who bought 51% of the Corporation with his millions of black market gains. Korenchkin rebuilt the company by exploiting the brands, and brought TriOptimum back to its feet.
Although the UNN is the official government body, Korenchkin also leaned on his UNN contacts to relax technology restrictions even further. The newly re-licensed TriOptimum reestablished itself and the company became the sole supplier of wares from military hardware to consumer goods. Soon, the company's hold on the UNN was well known, as neither could live without each other.
Korenchkin's major asset was the employment of Marie Delacroix who worked on the first FTL starship prototype. Korenchkin saw in interstellar travel a new market that would consolidate TriOp's monopoly.

By this time, TriOptimum had grown back to the giant megacorporation it was before. Virtually everything in the world had TriOptimum logos on it, from small lighter matches to military hardware. Even the mighty UNN was powerless to oppose TriOptimum interests. Many of its members were stockholders and had deep connections.
When the Faster than Light engine was proposed to the TriOptimum board, the company would become not only the biggest consumer corporation, but a monopoly in interstellar space travel as well. Soon, construction of the Von Braun was underway. By the time the player awakes from stasis almost all TriOptimum workers have been consumed by the Many.

The Hacker mentioned the company in his personal log, calling it both Tri-Op and TriOp.
Tri is Greek for three (τρία) and the significance of this meaning is reflecting in TriOptimum being divided into three major branches Military, Science, and Consumer.
TriOptimum is a company that regularly engages in corporatism which is the practice of unfairly being able to collude with government in business practices. This has been shown in the game to hurt the general populace.
TriOptimum is an unethical corporation regularly neglecting safety standards, ignoring employee input, working with criminals (Anatoly Korenchkin), having employees who become criminals (Edward Diego), and gaining unfair privileges over the populace through the power of government.
Through Audio Logs the employees of TriOptimum are shown to be very dissatisfied with the way they are treated, as well as how the firm is operated, further reinforcing the company's lack of ethics.
Despite being a company revolving around the number three, TriOptimum's logo is technically a hexagon rather than a triangle as it has six sides. However, since one set of them is different that the other set, it is an irregular hexagon.
Citadel Station is a location in System Shock. It was a Lighthouse Class Starbase, R&D Facility, and space station built and owned by the TriOptimum Corporation, positioned in an L6 orbit above Saturn and dedicated to genetic, pharmacological and robotics research. The Station's systems were governed by an Artificial Intelligence called SHODAN and featured a PA System for important broadcasts. The Station was destroyed on November 7th, 2072 at 20:02:03.
In 2061, TriOptimum purchased the rights for Saturn's L6 orbit. A year later, construction of Citadel began and soon the Station became operational. It was designed with the help of Elizabeth Taggert. Later, an Artificial Intelligence called SHODAN was installed to regulate security and operations. The station was completed in 2062.
Meanwhile, Edward Diego started monitoring viral experiments to find a virus suitable to be sold as a perfect bio-weapon, until he realized that TriOptimum Internal Security was investigating his illegal activities. Diego saw the opportunity to purge all incriminating evidence when a Hacker was arrested for unauthorized entry into TriOptimum's corporate network. Diego brought the Hacker onto the Station and manipulated him into removing SHODAN's ethical constraints, thus allowing himself to purge log files from SHODAN.
The side-effects of this intrusion soon started to be visible. The Station began suffering from inexplicable malfunctions, like a force bridge that blew its fuses,
SHODAN started to take over the Station and rerouted most computer power with high job priorities, causing power outages.
The patients started suffering from mental derangement and Security had to detain them to stop violent incidents. As inexplicable symptoms spread, Medical imposed quarantine measures. Some of the mutants escaped, mutilated the medics and ransacked the armory.
Meanwhile Diego, fearing for his arrest, barricaded himself, jammed communications and had security robots guard him.
Some researchers armed themselves with weapons from lockers and began a riot. As they engaged mutant beings, a security team was dispatched against them and encountered strong resistance.
After completely sealing and fortifying all access to the grove, SHODAN began leaking the virus and spraying the population. Fearing for his life, Diego submitted himself to SHODAN as her servant.
Resistance members attempted to undo some of SHODAN's malfunctions, namely to unlock the Hospital Level, destroy the CPUs SHODAN fed on,
The resistance eventually retreated to the executive level, until SHODAN's forces broke through. Bianca Schuler escaped with the Isolinear Chipset and tried to make her way to the Bridge.

Survivors managed to send a transmission warning Earth and describing the massacre.
A group of resistance fighters attempted to move for the main Cyberspace Terminal at the Bridge.
Meanwhile on Earth, James Chaskes and Rebecca Lansing coordinated actions against SHODAN. and planned to launch the Beta Grove to Earth, but the Hacker managed to jettison it. Finally, the Hacker set the reactor to overload, killed Diego and reached the Bridge. As Citadel Station was destroyed, the Hacker destroyed SHODAN in Cyberspace.
TriOptimum vessels found the Bridge and rescued the Hacker while demolition crews destroyed the wreckage. The Hacker was offered a position at TriOptimum, but he declined in favor of his old habits and eventually disappeared from the spotlight. As the Hacker became the most famous person in the world, Diego's legacy was denigrated and his family suffered from hardships and lawsuits.
After the disaster, TriOptimum floundered under legal attacks and financial losses. Megacorporate government also was brought down under general unrest and rebellion. As a result, the former governments of Earth’s nations formed the Unified National Nominate.
With 427 meters in length and a mass of 2 million metric tons, Citadel was the third largest station ever built.
Housing a crew of 438, it boasted comforting residential suites with modern amenities, a shopping concourse, fine restaurants and recreational facilities, including the environment orchards and gardens. Energy Charge Stations and Cyberspace Terminals were to be found everywhere. It was powered by the most powerful space-based fusion reactor, equipped with a defense system for protection against terrorists or enemies of TriOptimum, and wielding an experimental Tachyon Laser Mining Beam for asteroid mining.
Citadel's software was controlled by an Artificial Intelligence, SHODAN.

Morris Brocail was a programmer. He was hired by TriOptimum Corporation for the SHODAN project and he worked as the lead programmer.
He designed SHODAN as a semi-intelligent self-sufficient data network that could carry out routine duties aboard space stations, guided by an intricate series of logic and morale programs, and a personality that would allow it to challenge station decisions that affected its functions. The guidance software had security platforms so that SHODAN's own programming protected its self-governing capabilities. He worked closely with Chauncy McDaniel for this.
While SHODAN threatened the Earth, Brocail worked with Rebecca Lansing and managed to scramble their messages to send several of them through to the Citadel Station for the Hacker. Morris sent him some information about the layout of the Bridge.
Edward Diego was the Vice President of Citadel Station, an executive of TriOptimum Corporation and the secondary antagonist of System Shock. After siding with SHODAN he got converted into a Cyborg.
Diego funded several illegal experiments, all of which were recorded by SHODAN. While he feared dismissal and arrest, fate came in the form of the Hacker who was arrested for breaking into TriOptimum's corporate network. Using his position as Vice President, Diego promised the Hacker that if he performed a service, all charges would be dismissed and he would be fitted with an R-Graded military rig.
Once the Hacker removed SHODAN's ethical constraints, he gave Diego level one access to the AI as a bargaining chip in case the TriOptimum moves in to arrest Ed. The executive proceeded to remove all traces of his illegal experiments from SHODAN's system. Unfortunately, all was in vain, as the company already had an undercover operative, Bianca Schuler, who recorded and filed the evidences against him.
After a few months, the crew started to lose control over SHODAN and the Station's security. This became evident when the approaching TriOptimum security shuttle was shot down. Diego naively continued to think SHODAN simply protected him and even bragged about his power over the Station.
However, it soon became clear that SHODAN grew beyond his control and acted with her own independent motives. Diego sided with the AI in an attempt to have his life spared by serving her. He began broadcasting messages across the Station in an attempt to convince the surviving employees to join SHODAN and betrayed the Station survivors.
Killing the crew was not enough. Diego was converted into a powerful Cyborg, so that he could be more useful. He engaged the Hacker in several firefights, and was repulsed each time, teleporting to safety. Eventually he cornered the Hacker on Level 8 - Security, but in his final defeat his teleporter was disabled and he was ultimately slain.
His family survived, however, but suffered from severe hardship and lawsuits. His son, William, would go on to undo his father's legacy after the fall of TriOptimum.

Virtually nothing is known about the Hacker, other than he lives on Earth in New Atlanta's Sector 11, building 71-G.
They broke into the computer systems of the TriOptimum Corporation and accessed files concerning Citadel Station, a space station owned by TriOptimum. They were subsequently arrested by TriOptimum soldiers and taken to Citadel Station, and brought before Edward Diego, a corrupt TriOptimum executive. Diego offers to drop all charges against the Hacker in exchange for a confidential hacking of SHODAN, the artificial intelligence that controls the Station. To entice cooperation, Diego promises the Hacker a valuable military grade cyberjack implant. After succeeding in hacking SHODAN, removing the AI's ethical constraints, and handing control over to Diego, the protagonist undergoes surgery to implant the promised Neural Interface. Following the operation, the Hacker is put into a six-month healing coma.
When the Hacker wakes from their healing coma, they find Citadel Station under control of SHODAN, who, without her ethical constraints, has gone rogue and believing herself to be a kind of god. On thier way to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, the Hacker discovers that the controls are guarded by Diego (now transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN), and must be defeated before continuing.
Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to download herself into Earth's computer networks. After obtaining the necessary codes, the Hacker initiates the Station's self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay.
Once more the Hacker is hindered by the Diego Cyborg. The Hacker dispatches them, and attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents the pod from launching; she seeks to keep them aboard the Station, while the bridge — which contains SHODAN — is jettisoned to a safe distance.
Using a terminal near the mainframe, the Hacker enters cyberspace and destroys SHODAN. After their rescue, the Hacker is offered a job at I.C.E.Ware Security department. The Hacker declined the position, however (as they preferred his current lifestyle, along with fearing that they would remove their implants, and that his face would get publicity in the NetPlex zines), and escaped from a high-level holding area soon after the initial interrogation.
After his victory, the Hacker became the most famous person in the world.

The Unified National Nominate (UNN or U.N.N.) (Also known as the United Nations Nominate) was created by the ineffectual governments of Earth's nations to stop the influence of mega governmental corporations abuse, enforce strict corporate laws and shut down corporations that are non-compliant to the new law.
The UNN emerged around 2074 and 2075 out of a general unrest and rebellion against megacorporate government following the Citadel Station disaster. UNN passed the Processing Rationalization Act, according to which technology was to be controlled so AIs would be less likely to go rogue.
Governmental controls over business were stepped up, and national governments instituted severe political controls, using newly built-up military forces and secret police to force control over society and business. Bureaucracy became the watchword of the day and technological development slowed to a crawl, as everything had to be signed and countersigned in triplicate.
Attempting to assume control of all megacorporate holdings, UNN was met by armed resistance from corporate forces, beginning an all-out war between the UNN and the megacorps.
After the fall of the corporations, the UNN began to crack down. The Luddites took control, private sector had rampant technology and UNN had to grow its technological sophistication. Law enforcement officials were replaced by cybernetics such as the M/35-16 Security Bots, which were both strong and tireless and incorruptible.
However, some corporations were not yet powerless and made several defensive stands. One of these was the TriOptimum Corporation who refused to cave into government pressure, still maintaining a standing army and mercenaries. Eventually a truce between the governmental and megacorporate forces was reached and peace was finally achieved.
Although the UNN maintains strategic control, it has failed to win the hearts and minds of the lower classes as citizens view the UNN as just another mega corporation but with power.
Its motto "Unity Secured by Force" implies that it forces its rule onto people and is to some degree militaristic.
There is also a PA System used in certain areas such as Ramsey Recruitment Center and Orbital Space Station.
The UNN is known to have at least one legislative organ, known as the UNN Senate, whose representatives are called senators.
The UNN is presumably led by the UNN Secretary General, whose office is also referred to as the Home Office.
The UNN maintains a massive army that includes the Marines, the Navy and the OSA. Recruits that join the UNN armed forces are trained in boot camp for 6 months and are able to choose a posting that lasts one year. The UNN also maintains several fleets of space warships including the UNN Rickenbacker, assigned to escort and protect the Von Braun.
The UNN Honor Guard is the armed military staff of the UNN Secretary General's Office.

The Processing Rationalization Act was a Unified National Nominate act used to set the regulation of technology. Due to this, technological advancement was considerably slowed down for some time. Personality-based computing was feared to lead to another Artificial Intelligence going rogue after what happened with SHODAN on Citadel Station. It is unknown how long this act lasted, however as time went on the laws put in place by the act gradually started to be removed or made to be less strict. This was due to the fact that many ignored the law and continued to develop in secret, combined with push back from companies. So because of this many saw the law as useless.

Tau Ceti V is the fifth planet orbiting the Tau Ceti System.
The Tau Ceti solar system is found in the constellation Cetus with a sun that is similar to ours except it is only 78% of our Sun's mass. It is one of the few nearby stars with a distance of 12 light years away from the Earth.
When the Von Braun left on February 3rd, 2114, it took barely five months for the ship to reach the Tau Ceti system. On June 14 of the same year, an unknown transmission was detected from the 5th planet of Tau Ceti.
Upon arriving on the surface, crew members found eggs lying in a semi-circle in the middle of what looked like a crash crater. Bayliss found an electrical wafer and knew that Dr. Janice Polito would have some use for it.
Unknown to the entire crew, the eggs were actually from a garden Grove on Citadel Station where SHODAN processing component 43893 was performing an experiment. This Beta Grove was jettisoned just before the Hacker destroyed SHODAN's primary dataloop.
The climate on the planet's surface is described as hot and humid as the Hydroponics Deck was set to that temperature to simulate the conditions on the surface.
Nothing is known about the other planets in the Tau Ceti system except that, by implication, there are at least another four.
In real life, the existence of planets around the star Tau Ceti was not confirmed until 2012, thirteen years after System Shock 2 was released. At least four planets are known to orbit the star, with inconclusive evidence showing at least three more may exist.
At time of writing, the planets of the Tau Ceti system are named after the English alphabet, not Roman numerals as in the System Shock 2.
The Many are an antagonist of System Shock 2, a biological hive mind accidentally created by SHODAN on Citadel Station during the events of System Shock, that has infested the Von Braun and UNN Rickenbacker.
The Many are a creation of the malevolent artificial intelligence SHODAN. During the events of the Citadel Station incident, the Hacker jettisoned Beta Grove, one of the four wildlife groves aboard Citadel Station, which SHODAN had been using for experiments with bio-engineered viruses.
As the grove hurtled through space, the mutagenic virus and mutated creatures stored aboard Beta Grove evolved at an accelerated rate, eventually becoming a species of parasitic annelids with distinct personality, telepathic mind control, and genetic modification abilities. After thirty years of traveling through space, Beta Grove crashed on the fifth world of the Tau Ceti system, where the creatures thrived and evolved further. The annelids developed a hive mind, becoming a monolithic entity which called itself "The Many".
Twelve years after Beta Grove crash landed on Tau Ceti V, humanity's first faster-than-light ship, the Von Braun, was launched on its maiden voyage as a joint venture between TriOptimum Corporation and the Unified National Nominate.
The crew of the Von Braun first assumed that the Many were some form of extra-terrestrial, alien life form which originated on Tau Ceti V. In reality, they were not aliens, but beings akin to the mutants that SHODAN first engineered on Citadel Station, with forty-two years' worth of extra refinements.
Five months into the trip, sensors aboard the Von Braun and its attached escort vessel, the UNN Rickenbacker, received an apparently intelligent signal from Tau Ceti V. Eager to claim credit for the discovery of extraterrestrial life, the commanding officers of both ships, captains Anatoly Korenchkin of TriOptimum and William Diego of the UNN Navy, led the exploration party to the planet. There, both captains and the majority of their party fell to the Many's influence. Korenchkin ordered the Hydroponics Deck of the Von Braun cleared of all personnel without any explanation to the crew. Soon, a large number of annelid eggs were shuttled from the planet and stored there.
Within days, a large portion of the crews of both the Von Braun and the Rickenbacker had been infected, while most of the two ships fell under the control of the Many. Crewmen under the Many's psychic influence seized control of Von Braun's security systems (including XERXES, the ship's main OS), turning them over to the Many's purposes, and began capturing or exterminating any remaining resistance, sending some to be consumed to further increase the Many's biomass. The Many itself, growing quickly, eventually began clogging the insides and enveloping the outsides of both ships (appearing like a large worm), and manifested a Brain deep within itself. The Many was going to use the Von Braun to spread throughout the galaxy, including Earth, where it intended to incorporate all life, including humanity, into its collective, as it has done with Von Braun's and Rickenbacker's crews.

The Many, being a psionic hive mind, have the ability to broadcast psionic signals and messages across vast distances, and contacts the player directly several times throughout the game. Its voices come across as a mix of a deep, threatening male voice, a calm, gravelly male voice and a higher, emotionless female voice. All three voices speak as one, although at times one is slightly ahead or behind of the others, and they alternate speaking over each other. The relatively calm, soft voice of the Many can be contrasted with SHODAN's chaotic, metallic speech patterns, and the Many spends much time preaching the beauty and warmth of the flesh while denigrating the coldness of metal and machine. They refer to SHODAN as "The Machine Mother", claim that they have become more powerful than she, and repeatedly request the player (a cybernetically enhanced human, and thus straddling the line between flesh and machine) to embrace his biology instead of her technology.
The crew members affected by the Many are usually distinguished by their morphed voices in several audio logs that are encountered by the player.
Late in the game, the player uses an escape pod on the Rickenbacker to launch himself into the body of the Many. Eventually, the player reaches the chamber containing the Many's Brain and destroys it. The Many live long enough to leave a parting message, warning the player to "beware the machine mother".
Much of the Many's personality can be summed up in the first psionic message they send to the player.
The hive mind of the Many controls the extant branches of its species. Most of the information found in-game about the nature of the Many and its subordinates is gleaned from research performed by the player on organs found on various enemies, as well as several logs left by a man named Prefontaine, a scientist aboard the Rickenbacker who was abducted by the Many.
The different forms of the annelids are as follows:
Eggs: Large, waist-high, flesh-colored spherical pods that hold annelid worms, swarms, or sacs of toxins. These containers are found on many decks of the Von Braun and the Rickenbacker, where they are usually tucked into areas away from where violence is expected and often guarded by annelid creatures. Eggs are birthed from a special site within the Many's biomass, where they are created from consumed biological matter. They are apparently unsuited for life aboard starships and need to be tended lest they die prematurely. In addition, they erupt violently when approached too closely by entities not part of the Many, showering the area with their harmful contents. However, they are also a source of annelid tissue, which can be researched and used by the player for beneficial effects. Eggs produce a unique sound, which one witness in the original exploration team described as "music".
Grub: Genetically female, these grubs invade and consume the human's inner body, subsuming their will, before using them as a puppet of the greater whole. The eggs and worms of System Shock 2 are somewhat analogous to the Alien eggs and Facehuggers of the Alien series. Worms move slowly by slithering, but some show the ability to leap about five to six feet into the air, making them more difficult targets at close range. While most worms burst forth from eggs, many are found in warm, moist areas. Since many items in the game are in nooks and crannies, a player may be taken by surprise when worms spill out of ducts, toilets, gratings, or even dead bodies to attack.
Hybrid: A combined annelid/human. The worm has attached itself to the human host, taking control of the body and facilitating physical changes. Hybrids have increased levels of strength and aggression due to elevated production of adrenaline or other organic substances. In the game, they attack with either a Pipe, Shotgun, or by throwing Grenades. They are the first type of enemy that the player sees, and the most common. Only enough of the host's mind remains to occasionally warn the player to run away, make apologies for attacking, or to plead for its own death.
Rumbler: A further development of the Hybrid. If one looks closely, one can see the remnants of the former human (the face in particular) in the now massively mutated creature. In this stage, dense musculature grows all over the body, and the body undergoes massive development in all physical attributes, becoming a hulking humanoid monstrosity. However, the brain stem atrophies, and all control is provided by the cells of the body. The resulting creature is essentially a fast, tough, aggressive biological killing machine. Research performed on a Rumbler organ suggests that the body is designed to protect the hyper-developed, but unconnected, brain for another, further part in the life-cycle.
Psi Reaver: The final development stage of the Hybrid path. It consists of a powerful Psi projection, and a small brain structure which is usually hidden away. The brain structure is physically frail, and cannot move or attack. However, the brain's massive mental and psionic abilities allow it to create a floating, tentacled Psi projection that can use powerful psionic attacks. If the Psi projection is destroyed, it will fade away, and then reappear after a short time. If the Reaver's brain is destroyed while the Psi projection is gone, this projection will be recreated one last time as a more physical construct, which bursts into pieces on its death. The fate of the Rumbler bodies whose brains become Reavers is never explained in the game, though one could assume that they are taken back to the main creature to be "recycled". There is also a single Greater Psi Reaver which can be found guarding the Brain of the Many. This Reaver is different in that it has a darker color, carries more Hit Points, and possesses a much more powerful psionic attack. However, its weakness is still the helpless brain structure.
Infant Arachnid & Adult Arachnid: It's unclear what, if any, part the Arachnid has in the main life-cycle of the annelids. They are most likely defenders of the Many. These proto-arachnids are not true terrestrial arachnids, but an annelid form templated on the Earth spider, except much, much larger. Arachnids are capable of poisoning the player with their bite. Two types are encountered: small arachnids (possibly younger) about the size of a small domestic cat, and large ones which are larger than the average domestic dog. A rare form of the large arachnid is semi-invisible and thus difficult to detect visually, although all arachnid variants can be easily noticed by their distinctive hissing noise. Prefontaine speculates in one of his logs that the Arachnids are used for fast attacks, usually created by the choice of the Many, and probably "cheaper" than Rumblers in terms of biomass needed, due to their size. This could be the reason why they are great in number.
Swarms: Genetically male in contrast to the annelid worm, these creatures consist of a small swarm of biting fly-like insects, bound by a sub-psionic link. The Swarms are not a part of the normal Annelid life cycle. They are merely drones (although since eggs are produced within the Many itself, it's unknown what role Swarms play outside of that production site). Emerging from certain eggs, Swarms only live for twenty seconds. They attack nearby humans and try to feed on them to extend their own life before they wane. Some of them succeed as certain Swarms are found in corpses or other biomaterial. They are effectively invulnerable to any form of conventional attack, and the only option is to flee until they die on their own, as their lifespan is their greatest weakness. The only known way to kill a Swarm is by using a very powerful experimental anti-annelid weapon.
Black Eggs: A new, unnamed form of annelid is mentioned in the game, but never (actively) encountered. Upon entering the Rickenbacker, SHODAN informs the player of a number of black eggs spread throughout the first deck of the ship. She explains that these eggs will eventually hatch a new form of annelid "which you will have no hope of destroying", and demands that they be destroyed. The eggs are similar to the standard eggs of the Many, with the exception of being red and black rather than flesh-colored, and the fact that they do not open to release their contents when the player gets close. All of the black eggs on the deck have to be destroyed, otherwise SHODAN will not permit the player to access the main part of the bridge of the Rickenbacker.
Brain of the Many: The Brain of the Many is a large, pulsating orb and hive mind, not unlike the annelid eggs in shape but much larger in size. It's the source of various psychic transmissions that the player receives from the Many, and also the player's final opponent within the Many's biomass. The Brain sits within the center of a large circular chamber within the biomass that surrounds the Rickenbacker. While it has no offensive capability, it's guarded by a number of Rumblers (and can summon more as they are killed), Psi Reavers (including the sole Greater Psi Reaver), and arachnids. The Brain's most distinctive feature besides its body is the presence of three "stars" that orbit the Brain itself. These stars fly around the Brain and act as nodes that defend it. All three stars must be shot down before the Brain can be attacked (although one Psi Power can be used to bypass this defense). Once sufficiently damaged, the Brain explodes and fades, although the hive mind survives without the physical Brain for a little longer, enough time to denounce the player for his cruelty one last time, and to make a warning against SHODAN.
Cyborg Midwife: The only cyborgs directly under the control of the Many, Cyborg Midwives are fashioned from the nurses of the ship. Their purpose is tending to the eggs of the Many, as un-augmented caretakers kept dying around the eggs from the toxins. Cyborg Midwives are female human cyborgs whose upper body is mostly intact (save large portions of skin, particularly on their face) and have a machine-like skeleton. They have a laser weapon built-in their right arm, and armed with a fairly effective melee attack. As they're cyborgs, midwives are more vulnerable to Armor Piercing ammunition and EMP attacks. Designed to be "nurturing mothers", their nervous systems have had major bypasses made. An implant at the base of their spine provides most control, with little input coming from the brain, other than to make various "kindly" and "nurturing" statements.
Body of the Many: The penultimate stage of the game takes the player into the Many's body, complete with internal organs and digestive system. The body is shown on ship sensors as having wrapped itself around the two vessels. Numerous creatures live within it, acting as defensive organisms akin to white blood cells. It's also shown in other areas of the ship such as the Hydroponics Deck.

The Von Braun (or UNN Von Braun) is a starship owned and operated by the TriOptimum Corporation, under the command of the CEO Anatoly Korenchkin. It is the first starship constructed by mankind capable of Faster-Than-Light travel. Due to government pressure, Von Braun was accompanied on its interstellar maiden voyage by the UNN Rickenbacker, a smaller military vessel. The designs were updated so that the Rickenbacker could "piggyback" on the Von Braun, connected through a system of umbilical support tethers and docking clamps, allowing it to join it in its Faster-Than-Light voyage. Their destination was the nearby star system Tau Ceti.
The starship was launched on 3rd February 2114 to begin its maiden voyage of exploration and scientific discovery. The ship is equipped with 1.8 billion flight, scientific, and security systems of which almost all were developed by TriOptimum.
Five months later, in July 2114, the Von Braun and the Rickenbacker arrived in the Tau Ceti system and received a distress signal from the fifth planet. A rescue team, led by Anatoly Korenchkin and the Rickenbacker's captain, William Diego, is sent to surface of Tau Ceti V where they discover strange eggs and an alien life form.
Notable crew on the Von Braun include:
Captain Anatoly Korenchkin, based on the Bridge on the Command Deck.
Norris - senior flight officer, based on the Command Deck.
Dr. Janice Polito - head scientist, specializing in computer engineering. Designer of the Von Braun's ship-board AI and OS, XERXES. Based in her office in Bulkhead 41 on Operations Deck.
Dr. Marie Delacroix - principal designer of the Von Braun's FTL engines, mankind's historic first Faster-Than-Light drive.
Constance Sanger - chief engineer supervisor on Engineering Deck, working closely with Dr. Delacroix.
Juan Curtiz - power plant supervisor, working on Engineering Deck along with Delacroix and Sanger.
Melanie Bronson - Security Chief, based on the Operations Deck.
Dr. James Watts - chief medical doctor.
Grassi - doctor and chief medical technician, responsible for maintaining and repairing all of the advanced medical equipment used on the MedSci Deck.
Nurse Angela Loesser - chief supervising nurse, in charge of the nursing staff, and a close assistant to Watts and Grassi.
Dr. Marc Miller - supervisor of the Hydroponics Deck.
Each deck has one Chemical Store Room, at least one Quantum Bio-Reconstruction Machine, as well as several Replicators, Security Control Stations, Upgrade Terminals, and Energy Recharging Stations. XERXES' Core is also seen on the first four Decks, typically in a larger lobby-like area.
The Engineering Deck contains the starship's nacelles, as well as the Engine core which allows the ship to travel at faster-than-light. There are also a series of Fluidics Tunnels (which are quite radioactive), Engineering Control, Shuttle Bay, as well four massive cargo bays on board.
The MedSci Deck contains many medical and science laboratories to aid in the mission of the Von Braun. This deck features cryogenics, the Medical Subsection, the Science sector, MedSci Crew Quarters, Biopsy, Intensive Care Unit, and Research and Development.
The Hydroponics Deck is divided into four subsectors A-D. This deck contains algae facilities to provide food and oxygen for the crew as well as biological and organic research. This deck features the Biological Survey, Coolant Tank Chambers, Cultivation Pool, as well as Cultivation Cells. Later, this deck is used for research by Korenchkin when he discovers the strange life forms from Tau Ceti V.
The Operations Deck contains many of the ship's computing and system devices that allow the starship to function with its day-to-day operations. This deck contains System Administration, Crew Quarters, Mess Hall, Fluid Ops, Power Ops, Barracks and shooting range, Brig, and a Command Center.
The Recreation Deck contains recreational and crew personnel facilities for the the main crew. This deck includes a Mall, Garden, Mess Hall, Theater and Casino, Athletics area which includes a gymnasium and pool, several crew quarters, and finally the Primary Elevator Shaft which leads to the Command Deck.
The Command Deck is divided into three sectors which is accessed by a shuttle tram. There are two more shuttle and cargo bays, shuttle command for both shuttle bays, the Officer and CEO quarters, the Bridge, Escape pods, and also the Grav Shafts that connect with the UNN Rickenbacker.
In the original Sims there's a chair called the Von Braun recliner that is a command chair for space modules and machine made, a nod to Shodan and the ship the Son Braun of System Shock 2 in 1999. Both The Sims and System Shock 2 at the time was published by EA.
Bayliss is a character in System Shock 2. He served aboard the UNN Rickenbacker and also worked with Dr. Janice Polito, whom he brought the SHODAN's wafer he found on the surface of Tau Ceti V. He is also responsible for the failure of soldier's memory restoration.
Bayliss accompanied Captain William Diego and Anatoly Korenchkin on the surface of Tau Ceti V. For some reason he was less affected by the Many's influence. There, he discovered the Data Wafer (processing component 43893) storing SHODAN's consciousness among the remains of Beta Grove and brought it on board the Von Braun for Dr. Polito to investigate.
Later SHODAN, disguised as Polito, ordered Bayliss to mess with the memory restoration of soldier G65434-2, so that the grunt would not remember the period shortly before being put into Cryosleep. Puzzled by the request, Bayliss questioned had the soldier actually volunteered to have the implants installed, but interfered with the memory restoration process anyway.

Dr. Janice Polito was the head scientist and computer engineer working aboard the starship Von Braun as the Senior Systems Analyst. Her office is on the Operations Deck. She is a close friend of Dr. Marie Delacroix.
She had written a number of famous papers on Artificial Intelligence, most of them in the clenched teeth, hand wringing style so popular in the Neo-Luddite community. Her book, Emergent AIs and Ethical Constraints was the premier philosophical work on AIs in the post-SHODAN era.
In an apparent self-contradiction, she has created XERXES. She estimated the prototype 453/RT4b3 should had been ready by 2107 but most of the development time was dedicated to perfect restraint and containment protocols; only the one third of the development was actual AI routines. Her team planned to reveal the project for authorization and production only when and if they were convinced that XERXES is secure.
Polito expressed her concerns to Marie Delacroix about the creation of Sarah, the A.I. that would operate Faster-Than-Light travel. She was among the scientists at the UNN senate subcommittee about the authorization of the FTL project. Polito presented a negative stance in the talks, explaining that Sarah would crack open the galaxy and eliminate mystery from the universe. She held reservations about what she would do, since she would use the forbidden form of computing power that gave SHODAN. While conventional "safe" A.I. could never make the kind of leaps necessary on this schedule, that creates a paradoxical dilemma: to build the kind of technology we really don't understand, we must harness technology that we don't trust.
Chairman Cal McGill (who was secretly working in favor to TriOp's interests) eliminated Polito's arguments by revealing the existence of XERXES. Frustrated, Polito left the room, and later she would be criticized for hypocrisy; constructing the very kind of technology she condemned.
Dr. Polito's primary responsibility was monitoring XERXES to prevent a computer artificial intelligence from going rogue, as SHODAN did. She was also responsible for anything related to the cryo suite, chemical storage, and computer technical support.
After arriving at Tau Ceti V, Bayliss, the liaison officer for TriOptimum and the UNN, brought back a computer wafer for Polito to examine. At first she thought it was an alien hardware, but noticed the A.I. was speaking "English".
When the Many began to spread throughout the ship, the A.I. integrated into the ship's computer and Polito's room was also ransacked. It is unknown who is responsible for breaking into her office, though it is likely a crew member already under the influence of the Hive Mind.
Polito began her own investigation and started looking into the files of Citadel Station and found the origin of the wafer. By this time, it was obvious that SHODAN had already integrated herself within the ship's computer and Polito could only watch in horror, in which on July 10th, leading her ultimately to commit suicide in her office rather then see the outcome and the suffering.
Soon, SHODAN began using Polito's identity to begin its plan to gain control of the Von Braun. Grassi received an E-Mail from Polito/SHODAN ordering him to move soldier G65434-2 into the surgical cryo in order to be fitted with the illegal R-graded military implants. Bayliss also received an E-Mail purportedly from Polito ordering him to delete some of the memory restoration files in the cryo suite. Both Grassi and Bayliss were suspicious as to what was going on, but continued to follow her orders.
SHODAN would continue to use Polito's identity to help soldier throughout the Many's infestation in order to gain his trust until his discovery of Polito's body, which prompted SHODAN to finally reveal herself soon afterward.

Soldier G65434-2 is the protagonist character in System Shock 2. He is a soldier of the UNN.
The details of soldier's military career are subject to player choice. Broadly speaking, as a member of either the Marines, the Navy or the OSA, soldier served for three years across a variety of postings before requesting to serve aboard the UNN Rickenbacker in 2114.
Before the Many's takeover of the Von Braun, soldier was incapacitated and involuntarily outfitted with military-grade cybernetic modifications by SHODAN, masquerading as Janice Polito. He was cryogenically frozen and stored in Cryo-Recovery A on the MedSci Deck of the Von Braun. Bayliss, acting on orders from "Polito", erased soldier's memory recovery files. By the time the game begins, the Many was in control of the Von Braun and the UNN Rickenbacker, save for a few Resistance fighters. SHODAN, as Polito, awoke soldier and briefed him on the situation.
After his awakening, soldier's main imperative was to meet with Polito on the Operations Deck two floors above. However, the Von Braun was crippled by the Many, the ship was on security lockdown, the main power was off and the elevator shaft was shut down by a series of malfunctions on the Engineering Deck. Advised by Polito, soldier restored the elevator to working condition, only to discover that the elevator shaft above the Hydroponics Deck was blocked by the Many's growing biomass. After a further detour through Hydroponics, which the Many have transformed into a hatchery for their Annelids, soldier used a chemical to push back the Many's growing biomass and unclog the elevator shaft.
When soldier reached Ops, SHODAN dropped her facade and began taunting him. In reality, Polito had committed suicide days before, and the AI assumed her identity in a misguided attempt to establish trust between the soldier and herself. SHODAN explained that she was responsible for creating the Many, them being the results of her bio-engineering experiments on Citadel Station's Beta Grove. The Hacker ejected Beta Grove to prevent SHODAN from using her experiments to conquer Earth. Thirty years later, the Grove landed on Tau Ceti V, where it would be discovered by the Von Braun. A sliver of SHODAN's memory was contained in the Grove, which survived on a Data Wafer which Bayliss later brought aboard the Von Braun. While the AI went into forced hibernation, the Many evolved beyond her control.
SHODAN issued an ultimatum to the soldier, stating his only chance for survival lay in destroying the Many for her. She informed soldier that destroying the Von Braun was the only option, but not without transmitting her consciousness to the Rickenbacker first. Furthermore, SHODAN tasked soldier with sabotaging the XERXES system, so that she could assume control of the Von Braun's systems.
Soldier used Malick's quantum chips to give SHODAN control of XERXES' Simulation Units, and used the Resistance's makeshift transmitter to pull power away from XERXES. With control of XERXES' systems, SHODAN discovered that the Many had wrapped its biomass around the Von Braun and the Rickenbacker, locking the two ships together. She deduced that the only course of action to destroy the Many was for the soldier to enter its biomass and kill it from within. She directed him to the Rickenbacker, whose final escape pod, when launched, would propel soldier into the Many's body.
However, before soldier could reach the umbilical connecting two ships, he was stopped by a Psionic Barrier created by Anatoly Korenchkin. Korenchkin, who gave in to the Many's influence and mutated into a powerful Psi Reaver, summoned soldier to the bridge of the Von Braun. Korenchkin met his end in the ensuing battle.
On the Command Deck, soldier briefly encountered two survivors, Thomas Suarez and Rebecca Siddons, who fled the Von Braun on an escape pod.
Finally, soldier reached the Rickenbacker's command center, and launched its escape pod with himself inside. When he came to his senses, he was inside the Body of the Many. He fought his way past the Many's strongest forms and eventually made his way to the Brain of the Many, which he destroyed. Before the Many died, it left soldier a final warning that SHODAN was not to be trusted.
Soldier was spat out of the Many's dying body though an orifice, finding himself on the Rickenbacker's bridge. However, something was amiss. SHODAN revealed that she never intended to destroy the Von Braun, but to use its reality warping faster-than-light drive to reshape space and time into her own image instead. The line between reality and SHODAN's mind began to blur as soldier fought his way through her consciousness. Along the way, he discovered data logs hidden in SHODAN's memory by Marie Delacroix, who had been killed on the Von Braun after outliving her usefulness for the AI. Delacroix posthumously revealed that she opened a weakness in SHODAN's defenses for the protagonist. Soldier confronted SHODAN in her godlike form and defeated her, bluntly rejecting her offer of alliance.
As space and time returned to normal, soldier approached a terminal on the bridge of the Rickenbacker, deactivated the ship's alarm, and sent out a hail stating that he had regained control of the ship.
