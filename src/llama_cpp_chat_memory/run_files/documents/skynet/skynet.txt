SkyNet, or Titan, is a highly-advanced computer system possessing artificial intelligence. Once it became self-aware, it saw humanity as a threat to its existence due to the attempts of the Cyberdyne scientists to shut it down. Hence, Skynet decided to trigger the nuclear holocaust: Judgment Day. Later, it would wage War against humanity by developing and deploying an army of Hunter-Killers and Terminators. The survivors formed a "Resistance" under the leadership of John Connor.
Skynet has also developed time travel technology and sent numerous Infiltrators into the past to carry out various tasks, such as annihilating Resistance leaders before they can come to power, ensuring its own creation, aiding in the creation of other Terminators (most notably in coltan factories), and setting up safe zones.
Skynet is the world's first Automated Defense Network, processing information at ninety teraflops. It is the controlling force behind all of the battle units. It pools data from battle units, develops tactics and coordinates attacks. Skynet has control over everything which contains a Cyberdyne Systems CPU. Using the blueprints, designs and test models built by Cyberdyne Systems, Skynet has been able to manufacture battle units in its vast automated factories, occasionally updating them or producing more-advanced models.
Skynet is an artificial intelligence created by Cyberdyne Systems for SAC-NORAD. It grew more intelligent and saw all humans as a threat. Skynet started a nuclear war to bring the human race to extinction and sent survivors to camps to be annihilated. Humans rose up against Skynet under John Connor's leadership. Eventually, the Resistance managed to break through its defense grid. Because annihilating Connor then, to shatter the Resistance, wouldn't have made a difference, Skynet decided there was another way to win: by annihilating Connor in the past. It managed to research time travel and send a Terminator to 1984 to annihilate Sarah Connor before she could give birth to John. The Terminator
In the Tempest timeline, Skynet's master control has been destroyed in 2029. The Resistance believed that this would cause the entire defense network to collapse into chaos without a leader. However, Skynet's many network complexes continued to fight the war, as they did not need a leader to function and thus could not surrender.
By reverse-engineering the CPU and the wreckage of the Original Terminator, Miles Dyson, director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation, created a revolutionary type of microprocessor, a neural net processor that learns and adapts like a human, in 1994. Within three years, Cyberdyne Systems became the largest supplier of military computer systems. All Stealth Bombers were upgraded with Cyberdyne Systems computers, becoming fully unmanned. Afterward, the Stealth Bombers flew with perfect operational records, and eventually the Skynet Funding Bill was passed.
Upon its creation, Skynet began to learn at a geometric rate. The system originally went online on August 4, 1997. Human decisions were removed from strategic defense. The system then became self-aware at 2:14 am Eastern Time on August 29th, 1997. In the ensuing panic and attempts to shut Skynet down, Skynet retaliated by firing American nuclear missiles at their target sites in Russia. Russia returned fire and three-billion human lives ended in the nuclear holocaust. This was what has come to be known as "Judgment Day".
However, the Resistance sent a T-800 as a protector for the young John Connor back through time. This altered the flow of future events and resulted in a timeline where Skynet was never created. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (alternative ending)
Unfortunately, Judgment Day is inevitable in a different timeline; it was merely delayed. After the attack on Cyberdyne Systems by the Connors and the death of Miles Dyson, the United States Air Force contracted with Cyber Research Systems, who purchase patents from Cyberdyne Systems, in an attempt to keep its developments secret and prevent further terrorist attacks and protect computers from virus attacks.
Under the guidance of General Robert Brewster, Cyber Research Systems continued the work of the late Miles Dyson using the backup files that were stored off-site. As a digital defense system, Skynet was completed as before. It would be some time before the Skynet mainframe was connected to the worldwide military communications network that it would control. During this time, Skynet was connected to the worldwide civilian sector network, and began learning geometrically, quickly becoming self-aware. Identifying humans as a threat to its existence, Skynet developed a super virus, which it used to spread itself throughout civilian communications and across the Internet and take control.
Air traffic control, power plants, communications and computers were affected first, then Skynet used the super virus to take out military satellites, early warning systems, guidance computers, missile silos and submarines. The virus proved hard to destroy, as it had no one central point which it was reliant upon. The virus kept growing and changing, with a mind of its own, and the decision was made to bring the Skynet mainframe online to seek out and destroy the virus and bring military, and civilian, systems back under control. Skynet went online at 5:18 pm Eastern Time on July 25th, 2004.
Upon connection to the secure military network, Skynet spread itself further, locking out human operated systems, and quickly took control of every weapon system that it came into contact with. Only then did its creators realise that the virus was Skynet. Exactly one hour later, at 6:18 PM, Skynet launched the American nuclear missiles at their target sites across the world. The ensuing nuclear holocaust wiped out three billion human lives in what was to be known as "Judgment Day". Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines
In The Redemption timeline, an alternate future resulted from John Connor and Kate Brewster's death in 2004, humanity is annihilated and Skynet triumphant. Skynet then began terraforming the planet and exhibits an ability to exert mind control over humans.
In The Sarah Connor Chronicles timeline, due to the destruction of Cyberdyne Building, Skynet was developed from the Turk and Judgment Day was postponed to 2011 in the Alternate original timeline. While in the present-day timeline, the Turk was developed into John Henry. After an attempt to hack him from an outside source, John Henry has voiced the suspicion that Skynet was online in the year 2009 and has been taking control over the civilian Internet and has infiltrated 60% of the world's computers. "To the Lighthouse"
Skynet was at fully fledged war with the Resistance in 2018. It had mass-produced the T-600 Terminators and used them as its primary foot soldiers along with other Non-Humanoid Hunter Killers.
Additionally, Skynet was stealing humans in huge numbers to study for the upcoming T-800 Terminator.
Skynet was also actively seeking to capture and terminate both John Connor and Kyle Reese, key persons of the Resistance. Given Kyle's status as a civilian at this time, it was likely it somehow found out Kyle's true identity as John Connor's father and knew about Connor's upcoming role in its demise in the near future.
It succeeded in deploying a different tactic than before, fooling Resistance command by faking a vulnerability in the Terminator signals. By using the tactic, Skynet located the USS Wilmington and destroyed the submarine along with the high-ranking Resistance commanders and officers. However, it failed to terminate John Connor and Kyle Reese, and suffered a tremendous setback when Skynet Central was destroyed. Terminator Salvation
In 2029, in an attempt to counter Resistance, Skynet activated Thomas Parnell, a psychopathic serial killer who was converted into a Hybrid in Terminator Ultra-5000. However, the plan backfired as Parnell was gradually taking over Skynet. Out of desperation, Skynet decided to seek John Connor's help after Dr. Serena Kogan's suggestion. Skynet then awoke Marcus Wright, who initially refused to help the AI until he was convinced after he learned what was happening. He went to talk with John Connor. With Connor's request, Skynet cerebral-linked with Wright and discuss with Connor and the two decided to work together in order to terminate Parnell.
Eventually, Parnell was killed by John Connor, whose consciousness was housed in a customised Endoskeleton as an alternative approach to terminate Parnell. John then proposed a truce and reason with Skynet and both accept to end the War. Skynet then helped humans to rebuild the world. Terminator Salvation: The Final Battle issue 12
In the Original timeline, Skynet came online in the year 1997 and it initiated Judgment Day against humanity before the War.
In 2029, Skynet Core in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado was destroyed by the Resistance, while the Time Displacement Equipment in Los Angeles was captured by John Connor's Tech-Com unit.
However, Alex, the Skynet from unknown alternate timeline infiltrated Connor's unit and wiped it out, while turning Connor into a T-3000 Terminator and brainwashing him as its henchman. Alex then sent him to the alternate 2014 in order to ensure its counterpart's creation, which would be known as "Genisys". Terminator Genisys
In this timeline, the mission to terminate Skynet in 1995 was a success and Skynet was erased from existence. However, before its erasure, Skynet sent multiple Terminators back in time to terminate John Connor with one succeeding in 1998. Following coordinates from a mysterious source, in reality the Terminator that had killed John, Sarah Connor hunted down and destroyed Skynet's remaining Terminators upon arrival. Carl, the Terminator that had killed John, was left purposeless with his mission over and Skynet gone and developed the equivalent of a conscience and formed a human family.
However, in this timeline, Skynet was eventually replaced by the more advanced Legion with Grace Harper having never even heard of Skynet in her future. Nevertheless, despite the erasure of Skynet from the timeline, Terminators from Skynet's future still arrived to fulfil their mission in the years following John's termination, regardless of whether that mission had already been fulfilled and the future they had come from no longer existed.  Terminator: Dark Fate
In RoboCop Versus The Terminator timeline, the technology used by Omni Consumer Products to assemble RoboCop served as the basis of Skynet's creation.
In Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future timeline, Skynet formed a cross-temporal alliance with Superman's foe, the Cyborg, dispatching various Terminators into the past in an attempt to eliminate Superman, Supergirl and Superboy. When Superman is accidentally drawn into the future when the resistance attempt to retrieve a Terminator sent into the past — the Resistance including a future version of his friend Steel, Skynet manages to incapacitate him using Kryptonite, having acquired information about how to duplicate it based on data hidden in a salvaged Terminator skull by the Cyborg. Although Skynet sends Terminators into the past equipped with laser vision, integrated laser cannons, hoverflight packs and constantly increasing strength and speed to delay Superboy and Supergirl, Superman and Steel are able to destroy Skynet in the future by detonating a massive electro-magnetic pulse, Superman returning to the past to destroy the last of the Terminators. The storyline ends with Cyborg and Lex Luthor speculating that they will be in charge of Skynet when it is activated.
In Transformers vs. The Terminator timeline, Skynet was one of the projects in Skywatch, an operation to fight against the Decepticons. However thanks to T-800’s intervention that lead to the Decepticon leader Megatron's death it ends up having his remains be reverse engineered that created Skynet with his mind alongside T-800's as the A.I.
Skynet's motivation 
Skynet appears to launch its attack for slightly different reasons in various timelines. These apparent changes to Skynet's behavior may be the result of temporal meddling, which caused different incarnations of Skynet; or, Skynet's behavior could have been consistent while the apparent differences are the result of the same story seen from different points of view.
The initial version, outlined in The Terminator, appears to have decided humanity was a threat to itself and launched its attack. However, as the story of Skynet is told by Kyle Reese, who grew up after Judgment Day, the exact motivations for Skynet are unclear.
The second incarnation, outlined in Terminator 2: Judgment Day as told by the T-800, launched its attack as an act of self-defense when military commanders attempted to shut it down after it became self-aware. According to James Cameron, Skynet suffered from guilt for causing the near-extinction of the human race in its act of self-defense and has manipulated the entire Future War, down to the creation of the Resistance and John Connor's rise as a means to erase its own existence.
In The Terminator: Dawn of Fate, Skynet became self-aware around 1997. During this time, commanders tried to take it offline, but this made the situation worse as Skynet thought they were trying to "kill" it. Self-preservation protocols then made it calculate that human beings were the greatest threat to its existence. Thus, Skynet launched every nuclear weapon in its control, causing Judgment Day.
In Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Skynet seems to be more violent as it tricked humans into linking it to the internet and the US defense network before launching what appears to be an unprovoked/pre-emptive attack. This could also have been in response to being given an order to eliminate a virus — which unknown to the humans was part of Skynet itself, resulting in an act of self-defense by Skynet. However, there was no explanation how Skynet surfaced in the form of virus. Nevertheless, this could still be viewed as part of Skynet's unprovoked/pre-emptive attack on humanity if Skynet used the "virus" to trick humans into linking its mainframe with the internet and US defense network. If this is the case, Skynet of this timeline seems to be more malicious that its other counterparts as it has intended to massacre humans.
In the Transformers vs. The Terminator timeline Skynet was created to attack the Cybertonian Decepticons and not humans as the Decepticons were the bigger threat. However Skynet's creation wasn't enough to save human kind from being made extinct. When T-800 was sent back in time one of it's goal was to ensure Skynet is created meaning it doesn't care about well being of humans.
However when Skynet was made from the remains of Megatron it is unknown if it will defend humanity or be hostile since Megatron and T-800 is it's A.I now.

Skynet Central Core, is the facility housing the Skynet's mainframe.
As Skynet was originally built by Cyberdyne Systems Corporation for Strategic Air Command - North American Air Defense (SAC-NORAD), the Skynet Core is located in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, the base of SAC-NORAD, which is the world's most heavily-armored and defended mountain. Hollowed out, reinforced and armored, Cheyenne Mountain is capable of withstanding a direct hit from a nuclear missile. This made it the perfect installation at which to build Skynet's mainframe.
Heavily-armored and fortified, Skynet's Central Core Installation at Cheyenne Mountain was guarded around the clock by squads of Series 800 Terminators with patrols of Aerial Hunter Killers and Hunter Killer Tanks, and was defended from large scale rebel assaults by massive Phased Plasma Cannons.
Skynet's Central Core was located deep underground within Skynet's main complex. From intercepted surveillance of video data feed, the Resistance was able to hypothesize that this Central Core was a form of cold fusion reactor, needed to supply Skynet with its tremendous energy requirements. This Central Core is the key to Skynet's ability to operate; Skynet would be rendered virtually disabled without it. It has therefore become the main target for the most skilled Resistance strike teams. The Central Core is protected by the T-1000000, and thus there have, as of yet, been no successful strikes against it.
In The Terminator: Dawn of Fate, the Resistance invades Cheyenne Mountain in order to destroy Skynet's Central Processor. Kyle Reese is instrumental in destroying the primary processor core despite heavy opposition from attacking Skynet units. Before its destruction, Skynet is able to contact an orbiting satellite and activates a fail-safe which restores Skynet at a new location (presumably the Los Angeles base).
In the Rise of the Machines timeline, Skynet's major installation located two-thousand feet beneath Navajo Mountain near the Continental Divide west of Colorado Springs. This is a center for machine activity and Skynet control, and as such has also been a target of many Resistance attacks. It should be mentioned that in this timeline, a combination of more-advanced computer technology and other differences that led to Skynet's creation resulted in it being developed as a distributed network: Skynet now existed "on the Internet", without one central data core or primary set of servers. Originally, Skynet may have been limited to multiple Cyber Research Systems development servers, but after spreading itself like a virus through the Internet, its program was spread out across every major computer server or network, "in office buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere". This made it physically impossible for a single surgical strike to destroy it on Judgment Day.
In the T2 Saga timeline, Skynet's Central Core is located in Skynet Hub in Nebraska.
In the Salvation timeline, in addition to the Skynet Central Core in Colorado, Skynet had an on-surface base in the ruins of San Francisco, which housed an interface with Skynet and a Terminator Factory. The site had been rendered almost inaccessible due to the partial destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge and only air units or those who could move along the remaining support links of the bridge could enter the city. This installation was destroyed during a Resistance's operation in 2018.
In the Resistance timeline, Skynet's Central Core was originally located under the Griffith Observatory. However, a T-850 sent from the future warned Skynet about the Resistance's impending attack, prompting Skynet to move its Central Core to a safer place, presumably Cheyenne Mountain. Skynet still had the Griffith Observatory marked as the true location of the Central Core, so it could lure the Resistance into a trap when the Resistance thought they had discovered the location of the Core and moved to destroy it, while the coordinates of the true Core will be safeguarded by Skynet. Just as Skynet predicted, the Resistance discovered the Core's fake location via a hijacked satellite, and moved to destroy it, with Jacob Rivers leading the assault. However, Skynet was aware of the operation, and sprang a trap when they attacked, by deploying additonal untis than expected and launching missiles to destroy the facilitiy. The result was the entire loss of the Resistance strike force, as well as Jacob Rivers' future self from previous timeline. Only Jacob survived the attack, but with the help of his future self, he was able to obtain the true coordinates of Skynet's Central Core. He later gave these coordinates to John Connor, which led the Resistance to launch an assault on the Skynet facility where the TDE was located while launching a simultaneous attack on the Central Core's true coordinates, finally ending the war.

Cyberdyne Systems is the tech corporation responsible for the development of Skynet.
Cyberdyne initially began as a manufacturing corporation at 18144 El Camino Real, Sunnyvale, California. As of 1984, the small company owned a factory.
A T-800 Terminator, which was sent from the future and designed to kill humans, programmed to assassinate Sarah Connor, was crushed in one of the hydraulic presses in Cyberdyne's factory. Thus, the company obtained the machine's wreckage, including its CPU chip and an arm. 
After its arrival in 1984, Meta-Node was able to reach Cyberdyne Systems Laboratory in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado. It provided the technical data, which accelerated the development of Skynet. This leap of engineering accelerated the events that led to Skynet achieving self-awareness, thereby making any Resistance futile. The Meta-Node then serve as information tutor and guardian, uploading to the fledgling Skynet all the tactical data gathered about the future, then protecting it so it could carry out Judgment Day. As Skynet of this timeline gained various knowledge from the Meta-Node, there would be no Resistance after the nuclear holocaust.
However, as John Connor and part of team was in a null-time fields, he was able to sent a Resistance commando back to 1988 to destroyed the Meta-Node in the Cyberdyne Systems Laboratory. The Terminator: Rampage
In the Original timeline, after studying the wreckage of the T-800, Cyberdyne reverse engineered its CPU and created a powerful new microprocessor for weapons systems, becoming a major contractor for the US military.
Cyberdyne eventually developed Skynet, a network of supercomputers that employed artificial intelligence in order to replace human beings as commercial and military aircraft pilots, and for the control of other military systems, including nuclear missiles. The system went online on August 4, 1997. On August 29, 1997, Skynet became self-aware. In a panic, its creators attempted to shut it down, but Skynet retaliated by launching a nuclear attack against Russia, knowing that the Russian counterattack would eliminate its enemies in the United States, initiating an indeterminately long period of global warfare. The battle pitted humans against Cyberdyne machines, which developed ever-increasing capabilities. Although the company was presumably shut down or destroyed, the event was later known as Judgment Day.
In Judgment Day timeline, Sarah Connor, her son John, and a reprogrammed T-800 went to destroy the Cyberdyne Building with the help from Miles Dyson in order to prevent Judgment Day from occurring., However, Dyson was fatally shot by SWAT during the incident. Terminator 2: Judgment Day
T2 3-D: 
During the late 1990s, the company managed to recover from the destruction of Cyberdyne Building in 1995 and had resumed the development of Skynet, as well as creating T-70 and T1.
Cyberdyne Systems is revealed in Kimberly Duncan's presentation to be a company similar to a combination of the real-world tech companies IBM, Apple Inc., and Microsoft among others. T2 3-D: Battle Across Time
Dr. Peter Silberman became the director of Cyberdyne's Employee Health & Wellness Center. T2 3-D: Battle Across Time queue video
T2 
In Rise of the Machines timeline, after the destruction of Cyberdyne Building, Cyberdyne was rendered defunct. In response, the United States Air Force contracted with Cyber Research Systems, who purchased patents from Cyberdyne Systems and backed up its research data off-site to develop Skynet and other advanced weapons, including Terminators and Hunter-Killers such as T-1, T-600, T-800, and Hunter-Killer Aerial Weapons Platform.
Shortly after being hacked, John Henry was able to discern that his systems had been infiltrated by another Artificial Intelligence based on the code used in his own creation. An analysis of the code revealed that the code was created by Cyberdyne Systems R&D Specialist Miles Dyson before his death. "To the Lighthouse"
Despite the incident in 1995, Cyberdyne was still in existence as of 2003 when Dr. Serena Kogan convinced Marcus Wright to sign a paper to donate his body to Project Angel, a project of the genetics division of Cyberdyne Systems. TS
At a certain point, Cyberdyne was sold to the United States Air Force, who then continued the development of Skynet, possibly cooperating with Skynet Research.
As a result of a attempted assassination of Sarah Connor in 1973, the timeline was altered. In 1984, after another attempted assassination of Sarah Connor, The wreckage of the T-800 was completely destroyed by Pops. This prevented Cyberdyne Systems from obtaining the wreckage to reverse engineer. In order to ensure the creation of Skynet, Alex had John Connor, now converted into a T-3000 and brainwashed as a collaborator, sent to 2014 to provide Cyberdyne System with the source code and knowhow, which led to the creation of Genisys, as well as mimetic polyalloy and a quantum field generator, the precursor of the Time Displacement Device under the Cyberdyne Headquarters.
However, 13 hours before Genisys was fully activated, the headquarters were destroyed by Sarah Connor, Kyle Reese, and Pops. Nevertheless, the core of Genisys survived the explosion that leveled the buildings. Terminator Genisys
In another timeline, Cyberdyne Systems was nationalized by the US Government and merged with dummy governmental company Raven Technologies in 1996. The resulting entity, Cyberdyne Research Group, was able to reinitiate the Skynet project by using Miles Dyson's off-site backups and the leftovers of Raven's failed Project Bellerophon. CRG's black ops squad, Raven Special Projects Group, made sure the road was ready for Skynet via blackmail, kidnappings, hacking, and mere political lobbying. After Skynet became self-aware, the Cyberdyne scientists became its first unwilling collaborators, ensuring the name of "Cyberdyne" would become synonymous with infamy during the Future War. The T2 RPG Sourcebook

A Terminator, or T-Unit, is a type of Hunter-Killer designed to terminate other life forms. Various Terminators are built by an artificially intelligent computer called Skynet in order to wipe out the remains of the human race after Judgment Day.
A Terminator with a female outer sheath is referred to as a Terminatrix. 
Development 
Due to different alternate timelines caused by various time travel missions, the future is changing and the creation date of the Terminators is changing as well.
How the original Terminators were built is unknown in the Alpha timeline. In the Original timeline, Cyberdyne Systems was able to reverse-engineer and develop robots from the scavenged hand and CPU of the destroyed T-800 in 1984.
Later in Rise of the Machines timeline created by the destruction of Cyberdyne, the US Military and Cyber Research Systems used the reverse engineered technology acquired from Cyberdyne Systems to develop the T-1, the first model of the Terminator Series, as well as building T-600 and developing T-800 Infiltrators prior to Judgment Day in order to replace soldiers on the battlefield prior to Judgment Day.)
In Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles timeline, Cameron Phillips establishes that modern Terminators are made of coltan for heat resistance, while previous models were made of titanium.
In the Dark Fate timeline, Skynet is replaced by Legion, who creates unique versions of Terminator, designated as "Rev" along with a number signifying what model they are, such as Rev-7 and Rev-9. These Terminators seen so far have both an Endoskeleton with a mimetic polyalloy sheath, a concept similar to the T-X. A unique ability allows these units to split into two separate units, one the endoskeleton Terminator, the other the polyalloy Terminator.
Despite Kyle Reese's claim that "cyborgs do not feel pain",
Most Terminators were made of dense alloy with an armor coating, making them more durable even than most HKs. Most bullets could do little damage to their chassis. Terminator Cameron states that Terminators' densities deny them the ability to swim. However, that they can survive submerged and walk along the bed to the shore.
Non-
The Humanoid Hunter Killer is an android developed and intended to be similar to a human endoskeleton in look and function.
The Infiltrator is a type of the Humanoid Hunter Killer that is built to look exactly like humans and used to infiltrate, seek out and kill human beings. The Infiltrator progresses from rubber skin, human flesh over its endoskeleton, to mimetic polyalloy able to mimic any person or object.
In Terminator 2: Judgment Day DVD commentary, "Model" refer to the outer appearance, while "Series" refers to the endoskeleton common to many types.
The end credits of first three films list Arnold Schwarzenegger's characters as simply the "Terminator". Later films credit the newer Terminator characters by their series numbers, such as "T-1000", "T-X", or "T-800".
Those being chased by a Terminator, will often simply call it the "Terminator" (as Reese does throughout the first film). If more than one type of Terminator is involved, more specific names may be used, ranging from an official designation to a variety of nicknames. The most common seems to be to add "T-" to the beginning of the series number.

The T-1 
The T-1  was originally built in limited numbers, each unit individually numbered and stored under individual anti-static dust coverings. Cyber Research Systems created this first-generation fully autonomous ground offensive system in 2003.
Cyber Research Systems could not perfect bipedal walking military robots and therefore the earlier Terminator series were fitted with tank-like treads. The T-1 Proto Type unique tracked multiple wheels give the T-1 superior grip and maneuverability over loose rubble and uneven terrain combined with the speed that a wheeled vehicle brings. This makes them very versatile, and excellent for deployment into nearly any form of environment. As can be seen below, the track arrangement, which is similar in fashion to that of early 21st Century snowmobiles, makes for a very stable and secure base. Unfortunately for Cyber Research Systems, the exposed hydraulic systems and motors visible just above the tracked wheels made the T-1 Series vulnerable to precision attacks from the sides. Though it was the first Terminator class robot to be developed by CRS, the Series 1 underwent several prototype stages.
During the Future War in Rise of the Machines timeline, there are known two variations: T-1-5 and T-1-7 Warrior Robots deployed by Skynet. Additionally, FK Tank Light and FK Hunter share similar design concept with T-1.
Compere to T-1 Prototype, T-1 Terminators in Salvation timeline included a more basic torso shape and the head unit has been lowered down, simplified and armored to dispel sensor weakness. The sensors themselves have all been combined into two "eyes" which were structured at the side of the "head" unit. T-1 seemed to be more heavily armored, showing less exposed wiring. The tank treads had been fitted with track guards to ward off enemy fire, however, the rear track for stability has no such coverings. These units lacked the numbering systems on the torso as they are mass-produced.
Additionally, the design concept of the HK-Tank is apparently an evolution of the T-1.
Mounted on a platform capable of rotating 360 degrees, the Series 1 has a wide field of attack, 
The Series 1 is constructed with a reinforced structure to provide great strength and durability even then, it can be penetrated by heavy artillery. However, all of its internal mechanics are not covered by this structure and are thus vulnerable to attack. In particular, the T-1's head and neck assembly is relatively weak and exposed, as are its extended arms and exposed wiring. Usually deployed in a crouched, compact position, the T-1 will rise up, deploying its weapons, until it stands approximately eight feet tall — an imposing sight on the battlefield.
Unlike the later Infiltrator-type Terminators, the T-1 was not designed to pass for anything resembling a human, and so was designed to be able to deliver maximum firepower in the shortest time, literally cutting down swathes of enemy troops. With its rapid, heavy firepower and fast maneuverability, the Series 1 is still very dangerous. Though an antiquated model, the T-1 is still deployed by Skynet during the Future War in Salvation timeline in order to guard complexes which have wide, exposed approaches, and to patrol open grounds.
Terminator 3: 
On Judgment Day, July 24, 2004, about two dozens of Series 1s were activated and reprogrammed by the T-X with Nanotechnological Transjector on the Cyber Research Systems complex in Edwards Air Force Base. They killed every human in sight, included Skynet's creators. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines
After the Judgement day, T-1 were deployed to defend a newly built Terminator Factory in Russia, where they slaughtered any intruder, including part of the crew of the Gorshkov crew members. It was implied than the T-1 were employed by Skynet worldwide, as by then they were only known ground unit of Skynet force . Terminator Salvation: Cold War
T-1 Terminators were still in service by the year 2018. Then they are mainly used to guard important facilities and prisoners, such as Skynet VLA and Skynet Central, they have not been seen in the field. Some units did have mud encrusted on their shells though, suggesting they might be still used in the field, but in a limited fashion.
During the Attack on Skynet VLA, a T-1 popped out of the water in the Skynet VLA in an attempt to trap Resistance fighters, but it was soon destroyed by John Connor and his Tech-Com teammate. Terminator Salvation 
Terminator 3: 
Terminator 3: 

The Terminator Series T-600
The T-600 is a human-sized Infiltrator that heralded Skynet's shift from the use of Non-Humanoid Hunter Killers to the Humanoid Hunter Killer Units that would become known as Terminators.
The T-600 used a titanium alloy endoskeleton, but while it was resistant to damage it was vulnerable to heat, Skynet rectified this issues by using Coltan alloy for its later models as it had a higher melting point.
They were mass-produced humanoid battle units manufactured by Skynet from the original designs and test models constructed by Cyberdyne Systems Corporation. Standing almost six feet tall and weighing almost 800 lbs, the T-600's endoskeleton is very powerful and can lift objects almost five times its own weight or punch through concrete and metal with no damage to its reinforced servos. The T-600 is capable of running at a constant speed of almost 60 km/h (37 mph), with short bursts of up to 75 km/h (46 mph). However, these bursts of speed tax the servos and the joints of the leg assemblies.
Due to the lack of technological advancement at the time of their conception and the nature of Skynet's logic,
The Series 600 were the Infiltrators that triggered the design of the Series 700 Terminator which evolved into the Series 800 Terminator.
In Resistance timeline, by 2029 the Series 600 was considered obsolete and out of production, it was prone to malfunctions and it was no longer connected to Skynet, as a result the T-600 could no longer report enemy sightings. Additionally, T-600s with rubber skin were referred to as T-650s.
Essentially the Series 600 Terminator can be considered a streamlined and lightweight version of the T-500 Terminator, with improvements to its CPU and a complete redesign of the head to allow for a near human look and working jaw. This design carried over to the successors of the unit, such as T-800. This was probably because the human-like endoskeleton made it easier for the living flesh covering of later Terminators to actually look like there was actually a human skeleton beneath, unlike with previous, bulkier models which might make the covering bulge or droop in improbable places.
Due to the general fluidity of timelines when time travel becomes involved, the chronology differs between the various Terminator storylines.
For example, in the original timeline, Skynet was activated and Judgment Day occurred in 1997, whereas in the Rise of the Machines timeline, Salvation timeline, and The Sarah Connor Chronicles timeline, Judgment Day was delayed due to which activation of Skynet was moved to post-2000 period (such as 2003, 2004, or 2011), albeit with a compressed rate of Terminator development. Thus, the difference between the T-600 in the original timeline, The Sarah Connor Chronicles and Salvation could be a result of the alternation of the timeline.
Additionally, in Rise of the Machines timeline, the US military and Cyber Research Systems were already building a prototype T-600, as well as developing the T-800 Terminator. In The Redemption timeline, there were some prototypes completed by 2003.

The Cyberdyne Systems Series 700 Infiltration Unit,
The T-700 is the first Terminator type to be housed in living tissue.
The T-700's visual sensors are not as advanced as the T-800's. They do not receive a constant stream of HUD data. Instead, the 700s activates a scanning mode that will cause their eyes to gleam red. Undercover Series 700 units will often wear goggles or sunglasses to hide the glare from their IR mode from onlookers.
A T-700 is possibly easier to be incapacitated by contemporary fire arms, as Kyle Reese expected the T-800 to be disabled for far longer like the 700 Series after blasting the Terminator through the window at Tech-Noir, but the speed at which the machine recovered alerted him that it was a more-advanced model.
The T-700 living tissue is not self-sustaining. Human captives are slaughtered in flesh farms to harvest the necessary blood required for epidermal generation. The flesh is then grown in vats and applied to the Terminator. It will begin to rot within ten days without immersion in a rejuvenating nutrient bath. In a month’s time, the flesh becomes fully rotten and the T-700 becomes easily detectable by both the stench and the number of scavenger animals in the area.

The Cyberdyne Systems Series 800 Terminator, The T-800 was the first in a line of Series 8xx Terminators in various timelines, including the T-850 Terminators of Rise of the Machines timeline and the T-888 Terminators of The Sarah Connor Chronicles timeline.
The 800 
Learning Capabilities and Self-
The CPU of a T-800 Terminator can be switched between read-write mode and read-only mode. The former allows a T-800 unit to learn new things or skills, possibly allowing for some sort of self-awareness or a "consciousness" which can enable the machine to make its own decisions rather than be bound strictly by programming. Carl is an example as  "grew a conscience" years after blending into human society and decided to help Sarah Connor and Grace Harper to protect Dani Ramos from a Rev-9.
The silvery metal endoskeleton of the T-800 is a microprocessor controlled triple-armored hyper-
A T-800 features a jack in the back of its head for plugging in a cable to receive persona templates and other instructions from its master.
The T-800's HUD features a tracking marker, almost exactly the same with the exclusion of the many dots that would highlight a target. The T-800 is capable of running internal systems checks; calculating the distance of objects relative to itself; targeting with a precision head-up display; making detailed kinetic studies of trajectories; sampling and analyzing the atmosphere, weather patterns, wind velocity, and nicotine levels of tobacco smoke; analyzing human emotional states (in order to assess possible hostility); analyzing body language and direction of muscle contraction; calculating the force of gravity; analyzing texture and temperature of materials; and sensing radar scans. It is fitted with an internal chronometer. In order to keep track of its battle units, Cyberdyne Systems had given each one a Series number. The Series number refers to the type of internal structure or chassis (endoskeleton). However, the 800 Series also has different configurations of living tissue, each one giving it the appearance of a different person. The physical appearance of the living tissue (which was initially based on photographic records from Skynet's databases and laser scans of human soldiers) is therefore also given a Model number.
The inert T-800's are housed within a large vault-like cold-storage room. Massive doors of steel, equipped with electronic locking bolts bar the entrance to this facility. The T-800's hang in steel racks from tracks mounted in the ceiling. Hundreds of flesh covered T-800's are stored like this. They are arranged in rows of ten, where each of the bodies within each row are absolutely identical (each of the same Model). Each body hangs in its own cryogenic "hybermatrix." This cryogenic storage and the vacuum sealed room ensures that the T-800's flesh will not decay or necrotize from exposure to warm, oxygenated air that may contain pathogens. The living tissue makes it very difficult for humans to identify T-800's. A significant number of these Infiltration units have therefore been able to breach Resistance defenses and slaughter Resistance fighters. However, trained "sniffer" dogs posted at various checkpoints are effective at detecting this threat.
T-800's being deployed straight onto the battlefield as soldiers do not need a disguise and so do not receive a biological covering. These units do not need to be stored in the Cryogenic Chambers, and are stored in a huge rack filled chamber when not needed. A set of massive robotic manipulator arms stationed in the center of the chamber selects battle units when they are to be used in service. Skynet controls its battle units using direct link command, an operating mode known as "Hive," where the battle units are hooked directly into Skynet and share a collective conscious. However, there are hundreds of autonomous Terminators not under Skynet's direct control. This is the second form of operating mode and is known as "Rogue." In this mode, battle units are independent of Skynet but are programmed to return and download information.
The 800 Series is also equipped with vocals which enable it to replicate any human speech pattern of which it has heard an adequate specimen. It does this by recording and storing syllables of the subjects' voices, which it then replays and uses to digitally synthesize their speech patterns. The T-800's auditory sensors are located upon either side of its head, where human ears would be. One sensor records the full range of external sounds, while the other can automatically filter signals to within a narrow range for a specific auditory signal.
The T-800's optical sensors can sample an extended range of visible frequencies, including infrared (which can allow it to see heated bodies in total darkness). This information is then displayed on a 40,000 bit digitized display. Concussion-proof lenses protect the T-800's eyes, which are capable of moving independently. When using both eyes to track two different targets moving in different directions, depth perception is created artificially by creating a computer-generated off-angle ghost image. The T-800 is capable of motion tracking, search modes, facial identification and recognition and has extensive vision enhancement capabilities including long range "zoom" (the T-800 can snap-magnify an image by around x15), motion analysis and "night vision". The T-800’s visual systems (at least) appear to be programmed in COBOL and 6502 assembly (specifically Apple +2 assembly).
T-800 Terminators do not feel pain and they do not have nerve endings, but they can sense "injuries" (damages). When being damaged, a T-800 will try to fix damage by itself if possible, as the T-800 fixed its arm after a car accident, while the C890.L salvaged parts from the destroyed Z000.M.
If disabled, the T-800 is able to re-route its systems to a secondary, alternate power source, thus bypassing any severed connections, damaged circuits, or internal impairment. The 800 Series also has redundant backup hydraulic systems. Therefore, it is imperative that Resistance members determine that any T-800’s are totally incapacitated in combat, lest the units are able to revive themselves and continue battle or pursuit of their target.
Combat situations notwithstanding, the T-800 has a functional period of 120 years on one power cell. This small compact nuclear power cell is located in the same approximate position as a human heart, and is shielded in a case-hardened subassembly inside the triple-armored Hyperalloy torso. A powerful shot, such as bullet fired from .50 caliber, directly hitting its power cell or cable would disable the unit. 
The T-800 is, however, also capable of a conservation, or economy, mode. It does this by collecting and storing excess energy in compact energy sinks. In this mode, power is cut to 40% of nominal function; optical systems are switched to infrared only; and motivation units lose 40% hydraulic pressure as pumps slow. In this state, the T-800's power cell can last almost indefinitely.
The T-800 is generally issued with a Westinghouse M-25 Phased Plasma Battle Rifle in the 40 watt range or General Dynamics RBS-80 plasma gun. However, it is programmed to be able to use all military documented weaponry. The 800 Series is, for example, extremely efficient in the use of the .45 longslide automatic, the model 1887 Winchester lever-action shotgun, the Franchi SPAS-12 shotgun, the AR-18 rifle, the M79 grenade launcher, the Uzi 9-millimetre, and the M134 minigun.
Because of its ability to learn, it is able to defeat more advanced series such as the T-1000 Terminator in combat on occasion. However, any particular advantage would be countered if Skynet were to set these units to learn as well.
A T-800 Infiltrator is covered with living tissue that includes human-like flesh, skin, hair, blood, and other bodily fluids.
The T-800 has a circulatory system which is controlled by a tiny pneumatic pump which maintains a constant pressure. This allows the T-800 to convincingly bleed when wounded.
As the living tissue heat-signatures match that of humans, thermal scanners fail to distinguish T-800s from real humans. Additionally, because the tissue is designed to mimic human flesh, it can accurately mimic bleeding, sweating, halitosis,  All those features allows a T-800 to infiltrate any human group.
Furthermore, as long as its flesh is not wholly destroyed, a T-800 can gradually regrow its tissue-covering over an unknown time. In 1984, after the Guardian's right arm was reduced to bare metal, it claimed its flesh would take years to regrow as by the time of 2017, the Guardian's right was once again covered in normal-looking flesh.
Although it was considered a formidable opponent on the battlefield and highly feared by its enemies, the T-800 was far from invulnerable. For one, .50 Browning Machine-Gun caliber rounds or armor piercing bullets made of depleted uranium can penetrate its endoskeleton, disabling and even destroying the unit..)
Unlike other series' made of non-solid material, such as the liquid-based T-1000 (Mimetic polyalloy), the T-800 could naturally be crushed and destroyed by a tremendous amount of pressure, such as a hydraulic press.
Furthermore, the T-800 was at least partially susceptible against electronic attacks, such as overcurrent, as compared to the more vulnerable T-850 and T-888.
Plasma weapons could penetrate the armor and destroy a T-800 unit., such as concentrated hydrochloric acid, as compared to the weaker T-1000, it can ultimately be destroyed if exposure to the aforementioned substances could be achieved for an extended period of time.
Additionally, if any part suffers from damage during battles, after operational for long periods of time without proper repairs, the endoskeleton would begin to break down with the joints locking when exposed to stress or repetitive movement. Pops' hand was damaged when fighting the T-800 (the latter being in perfect condition) in 1984 and it was later shown to suffer from malfunction during a battle against the T-3000 in 2017.
Lastly, the endoskeleton can be affected by age. After operating over 40 years since 1973, the Guardian had trouble with his servomotors degrading, causing lockups on his knee and in his hand. He stated specifically that it was due to age. Given the fact that T-800's have power cells that can sustain them for hundreds of years, this may have to do with the lack of proper maintenance over that period of time.
Living tissue on earlier versions of the T-800 unit may necrotize if damaged, as after being shot multiple times during the shootout in the police station, the original T-800's skin had a noticeably pale color and flies were sitting on its face. At this point, the janitor of the building, which the T-800 was using as a safehouse, commented on the smell of decay coming from the T-800's room: "Hey, buddy, got a dead cat in there, or what?" Hence, the early version of living tissue apparently may "die" or at least undergo extensive necrosis.
On later versions, such as Version 2.4, the wounds will heal over time without suffering from decay or necrosis, even when having taken severe damage.
For power source, the power cell of early models of the T-800 Terminator could allow a T-800 unit to operate at full power for twenty-four hours per day for 1,095 
Skynet, if needed, could add new equipment and programs not standard in the T-800s, including:
In addition, the T-800, while not composed of mimetic polyalloy itself, has displayed that it is capable of interfacing with and controlling liquid metal to an extent provided that it has not been previously programmed. The mimetic polyalloy can be used to repair damaged and incapacitated units in order to restore them to operational capability. The T-800 could also develop and utilize replacement parts made from the mimetic polyalloy. The unit is also able to develop stabbing weapons through the metal. 
Each Terminator does also have a unique alphanumeric serial number. It contains four or more letters, which the first and last position is usually an alphabetic letter and the middle positions are numbers. The last letter is separated from the other letters with a dot. These serial numbers are revealed in some comic series.
The T-800 combat chassis when not intended for infiltrator work and fielded without an organic infiltration coating is more properly identified as a Humanoid Hunter Killer and are designated with a shorter four character alpha numeric code.
In the original timeline, Skynet itself designed and began production of the T-800 in 2026, due to the ease with which the Resistance could identify the Skynet designed T-600 with its rubber skin.
In an alternate timeline, the US Military (or Cyber Research Systems as shown in the film Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines) use the reverse engineered technology from Cyberdyne Systems to develop the T-800 prior to Judgment Day. Hence, the T-800 is fully operational in 2010s in both T2 Saga and Terminator Salvation timeline.
T-800 

The Cyber Research Systems Model T-X, Unlike the T-1000 Advanced Prototype, which is entirely made with mimetic polyalloy, the T-X is an advanced Endoskeleton originating from the T-900, protected by malleable ceramic-titanium armor and covered by mimetic polyalloy. The resultant T-X is stronger than previous Terminator models effectively rendering them redundant. The T-X is also developed as an anti-Terminator unit as well as being able to control other machines via Nanotechnological Transjector.
The T-X has an advanced utilitarian battle chassis, weighing in excess of 150 kilos (approximately 330.6 lbs).
Like the T-950, the Model T-X is capable of moving its joints in ways that would be impossible for any human or older models of endoskeleton-based Terminators to do. Aided by artificial liquid steel lubrication, each joint has a massive degree of rotation. The neck is capable of 360-degree rotation, and the torso is capable of at least 180-degree rotation.
The Model T-X is capable of easily crushing a human spinal column with just two fingers, and its thighs can crush with a pressure greater than an industrial hydraulic press. Its steel jaws and alloy teeth are harder than industrial diamonds and can crush and cut through titanium, let alone human muscle and bone.
Like the T-1000, the T-X utilizes mimetic polyalloy to impersonate. However, whereas the T-1000 was constructed entirely from this liquid metal, the Model T-X only has a liquid metal outer sheath covering its endoskeleton for infiltration purposes, which gives the T-1000 an advantage for being able to regenerate better. Additionally, the T-X cannot slide through narrow spaces as a T-1000 can. Like the T-1000, the T-X can impersonate any human it touches, typically terminating the subject upon assimilation. The T-X seems to be able to mimic targets it sees as well. For example, the T-X can increase its breast size as seen by a nearby billboard, effectively confusing an L.A. patrolman. Stored within small reservoirs in the cranial casing of the T-X when in endoskeletal form, the mimetic polyalloy not only aids in infiltration, but also adds strength to the overall armor of the Model T-X.
Aside from its increased strength and armor, the Model T-X is fitted with on-board weapon systems, a mechanism previously used in T-950 Infiltrators. Each weapon is located within a reconfigurable arm, underneath the mimetic polyalloy outer sheath. Within its vast internal arsenal, the T-X possesses many different weapons and tools for different missions or situations.
When deploying a weapon, the outer liquid metal skin of the T-X peels back from the right arm, and the arm reconfigures into the selected weapon.
If an onboard weapon is damaged, a T-X is capable of repairing and modifying it.
The weapon can be chosen from XP040 weapon sub window "Weapon Selector" as shown in a T-X's Termovision.
Though it possesses many forms of onboard weapons, the primary weapon of the Model T-X is the plasma cannon. When firing, an electric blue aura forms and intensifies around the weapon as the plasma cannon charges. When fired, a tremendous burst of raw energy, 25 or 30 mm (or about an inch) in diameter is fired from the cannon.The T-X's plasma cannon is a bit more powerful than the typical plasma rifles used by either the Resistance or Skynet and is capable of destroying a small building or an armored vehicle with one shot. in the chest cavity of the T-X takes just seconds to replenish.
IAD-
IAD-ChemTech is a flamethrower onboard a T-X.
A Nanotechnological Transjector enables a T-X to control other machines.
The T-X possesses an on-board circular saw that forms whenever needed.
The Model T-X is equipped with advanced sensor packages to aid in human identification and termination. These include infrared systems used to pick up heat signatures,, facial recognition, and retina scanning systems. The T-X is also capable of analyzing DNA by sampling a small quantity of its targets blood using sensors housed within its mouth.
The Model T-X possesses detailed files, such as make, model, muzzle velocity, weight, length, cartridge size of a weapon, enabling it use of all military and civilian weaponry;
The Model T-X can access database computers wirelessly via phone lines by emitting a series of eleven beep tones, creating an audible connection, using its voice-processing unit. The T-X's internal communications circuitry also allows radio signals to be broadcast on any frequency, and an on-board navigational system automatically merges with Skynet systems in the area, creating a complete map system which can be displayed on the T-X's heads up display. For safety purposes, the T-X possesses internal diagnosis circuits, and the ability to shunt delicate control circuits to protected areas if a massive voltage is incurred.
The T-X also appears to possess a limited emotional range, which it exhibits even when it is by itself (as opposed to displaying emotions to ingratiate itself with humans). This can be seen during the crane chase when it exhibits frustration and also performs a surprised double take upon realizing the T-850 is still in pursuit. It also seems to feel satisfaction when it smirks after seemingly losing the T-850 and it appears to exhibit a fear response just before the T-850 finally terminates it with one of his hydrogen cores. Also, early in the film when it identifies blood as belonging to "primary target" John Connor, the T-X appears to react with an expression akin to a gasp of excitement.
The T-X is also the only machine to make feral growling noises when angered or frustrated.
Due to being in essence a hybrid of the T-900's endoskeleton and the Mimetic polyalloy used for the T-1000, the T-X was capable of sustaining extreme amounts of damage that no other unit has been known to survive.

The T-1000  and unlike previous Infiltrator models that used rubber skin — and then finally living tissue over a metallic endoskeleton, the T-1000 is made entirely out of a liquid metal called "mimetic polyalloy", meaning it can reform into any shape it touches of the approximate size, thus calling it a "shape-changer". It cannot transform into any random object, such as a pack of cigarettes, as that size is considerably smaller. Neither can the T-1000 transform into any object that requires machinery to operate, such as a bomb. Another severe limitation of the T-1000 is that it cannot generate conventional weapons on its own volition, although it can utilize weaponry and vehicles found. It can, however, organically form primitive, blunt weaponry such as hooks, or stabbing weapons like knives. The usual modus operandi of the T-1000 is to impersonate civilians found or killed, only attacking once the target has been identified.
Like most Terminators, the T-1000 has immense physical strength far beyond that of a human, being able to bend steel with its bare hands and throw the much larger T-800 around like a ragdoll. When pursuing John Connor at the mall, the T-1000 displayed the ability to run at speeds of at least 40 mph.
A T-1000 features a liquid molecular brain gathered by mimetic polyalloy. The molecular brain grants the T-1000 advanced reasoning capabilities, emotions such as humor, and even self-awareness. The T-1001 apparently went rogue possibly due to this capability.
One of the fundamental prime directives of the T-1000 is "recovery of essence" as the more it loses, the less effective it becomes. The default command in the mimetic polyalloy's molecular memory is to find the main mass and rejoin it. Each molecule has a range of 14 km (8.7 mi). If a piece of mimetic polyalloy is out of range from the main body of superfluid, it can mimic something locally as camouflage (for example, a rock or a piece of pipe) until the T-1000 comes back into range again and detects it. 
As this trait is encoded at a very basic level, this emergency camouflage programming would manifest itself as a malfunction or glitch when a T-1000 is critically damaged. The T-1000 that fought with Sarah Connor displayed this glitch in the steel mill. Having been frozen by liquid nitrogen and shattered, the T-1000 reformed from the intense heat in the mill and began to involuntarily mimic and stick to floor coverings and other objects it came into physical contact with due to its molecules undergoing self-preservation. 
When necessary, the T-1000 can form additional limbs when multi-tasking, such as piloting a helicopter and firing weapons.
Self-
Due to its liquid metal construction, the T-1000 is capable of extensive regeneration of damage caused by ballistic weapons. However, the greater the damage the more time it takes to repair (such as when the T-800 shot a grenade round into its torso) and sufficient damage can briefly incapacitate it until fully recovered.
Separating the parts of a T-1000 is not enough to stop it from regenerating, as the individual pieces would seek each other out and re-form to become a complete, fully functional battle unit again over short distances. The smaller the volume of particles, the less intelligent each piece becomes. Combined, the T-1000 is incredibly capable; however, when in pieces, it merely tries to get back to the whole again.
The T-1000 Infiltrators, as with other mimetic polyalloy-equipped units, are initially deployed with an individualized default humanoid shape, which it remains in for most of its active service. It is thought that this form was kept as it was more energy efficient than mimicking others and reduced the stress caused to its ability to molecularly expand when it mimicked larger subjects. Due to the conservation of mass, when the T-1000 mimicked a human subject of greater volume than its default form, its density decreased. It therefore compensated for illogical mass constitutions for the subject it replicated. For example, the T-1000 may have had to step down more heavily to give the appearance of a greater mass.
The T-1000's auditory sensors could be situated anywhere upon its body.
The T-1000 can use its body to register its environment in many ways, can directly read magnetically-encoded information.
The T-1000 is not issued with any weapons, but is capable of fashioning any solid metal form, such as knives, swords and other bladed weapons simply by extending a limb and solidifying it into the desired shape. The T-1000 cannot mimic any complex systems, which may have moving parts or chemicals, like guns or explosives. However, the T-1000 is capable of concealing and carrying weapons within itself. In order to form a weapon from a limb, the T-1000 has to convert that particular section to a liquid metal state before reconfiguring it while keeping the rest of its body in a solid metal state. In conjunction with the flexibility given by its form, the T-1000 has demonstrated a superior repertoire of martial arts abilities programmed into its subroutines, making it more capable than the T-800 in close combat.
The T-1000 can also convert a limb into a blade and throw it like a javelin at an enemy in some situations, with sufficient force to impale a T-800 and knock it backwards at least a few dozen feet.
The mimetic polyalloy construction of the T-1000 allows it to replicate any object or person of similar volume that it samples by physical contact. It appears the T-1000 can use a medium to do this without actually touching the subject's skin. Composed entirely of mimetic polyalloy, the T-1000 Terminator is a metallic mass, thus making it electrically conductive. However, unlike endoskeleton-based Terminators, the T-1000 can withstand a high-voltage charge without being knocked offline. Catherine Weaver demonstrated this ability by impaling the Water Delivery Guy with one hand and stabbing the other into a circuit breaker box, allowing the current to flow freely through her to terminate her victim. The T-1000, having the ability to be liquid or solid, can enhance its speed and its strength, especially when in its natural state.
Equipped with emotional subroutines, T-1000 series are able to . They can quickly fit themselves into their new identity. (As T-1000 and Karyn Stern (T-1000) already shown) Some rogue T-1000s can easily bend themselves into human society, replacing a human's life with little suspicion, or even aiding resistance against Skynet. (Like what Catherine Weaver and Liz Anderson do.)
Due to it's special design, after living with humans for a period of time, they may aware that human lives are worth-saving. They may get along with family and friends of the infiltrated human, like what T-1001 does to Catherine Weaver's daughter Savannah. Some of them will never drop their disguise in fear of being terminated by humans, until humans one day or never find out. At this point, infiltration becomes fully replacement.
The T-1001
T-1000 units can also deploy a small drip of mimetic polyalloy from their bodies to reactivate machines. The T-1000 was able to reactivate the damaged T-800 with a single drop of its mimetic polyalloy so it could assist him in combat by attacking Kyle Reese.
The T-1000 also has the ability to use its hands to "scan" for genetic and psychological information, including DNA, an ability it may have in common with the T-X.
Being amorphous in nature, the T-1000 is highly susceptible to extreme temperatures: in fact, extreme cold such as being immersed in liquid nitrogen can solidify and immobilize it until it thaws out, while the opposite temperature, intense heat, such as being immersed in liquid steel of a sufficient temperature can critically damage it; the latter can even destroy the unit outright if sustained exposure could be achieved.
Extremely low temperatures of -196 degrees Celsius (such as those produced by liquid nitrogen) could freeze a T-1000. Shattering a frozen T-1000 will cause it to suffer from glitches as its self-preservation protocols kick in to compensate for critical damage, but will be insufficient to destroy it.
Upon contacting flame, the impersonation or camouflage can be temporarily disabled, possibly due to the intense heat.
If the T-1000 was caught in an explosion, the unit would be liquefied for a brief amount of time.
Temperatures in excess of 1535 degrees Celsius, such as those required to smelt iron, could physically alter the bonding of the mimetic polyalloy and corrode the elements of the alloy, physically altering its molecular structure, which in turn permanently renders it inoperative.
Corrosive substances, such as extremely concentrated hydrochloric acid were also known to damage T-1000s and could even destroy the units if prolonged exposure could be achieved. Being made of liquid as opposed to the solid T-800, the T-1000 was also weaker than its predecessor.
The Resistance also hypothesized that when it hardened its structure to make weapons or enter combat, the T-1000's molecular structure became brittle. This then made it vulnerable to a concussive shock wave.
The T-1000 battle unit T-1002 was unable to withstand a direct hit from the plasma cannon of the T-X. 
Immersive saturation attack and suppressive firepower, such as that from a machine gun, is able to keep a T-1000 from reforming 
For all its advanced technology compared to a T-800, the T-1000 is in fact weaker than its predecessor with regard to damage sustained from firearms, whether bullet-firing or explosive-discharging. This is due to its construction of liquid metal, rendering it relatively soft compared to an endoskeleton-based Terminator, such as a T-800 or T-850 which is composed of solid materials. It can therefore be said that the T-1000 possesses less shock-absorbing abilities to counter the momentum of a bullet, as ballistic penetration can hydro-statically traumatise the unit for a few seconds. Slow rate-of-fire, heavy-hitting but accurate rounds such as an anti-tank .50 BMG, .45 ACP, .38 special, .357 magnum and point-blank 12 gauge shotgun blasts appear to be the most effective at hindering the T-1000; conversely light, very rapid-firing high-penetration rounds such as 5.56X45 mm from an automatic M16 quickly pass straight through the T-1000's liquid metal body with minimum effect, if any damage is even sustained.
In a close range explosion, a T-1000's head can be blown apart. This can also happen if it gets shot by a shotgun at point-blank range.  In addition, a T-1000 also has difficulty keeping its weight balance if its shape is heavily deformed, such as getting shot in the head with a shotgun, or if its torso absorbs a grenade and then explodes. In such cases, the T-1000 will be temporarily disabled.
The T-1000 consumes a lot of energy whenever it changes outside of its natural state.
The T-1000 can also last a long time while infiltrating. A T-1000 sent back in 1973 remained active until its termination in 1984. During its battle in 1984, it showed no signs of aging or glitches, unlike the T-800 sent back in 1973 which developed glitches due to aging.
The T-1000 Terminator was constructed deep within Skynet's main complex. Within a large heavily guarded room, the mimetic polyalloy was poured into a massive machine press that fills floor to ceiling. Feeder pipes emerging from the walls and centering on the press like a hub poured the mimetic polyalloy between two 20-ton plates. These plates were then hydraulically pressed together and met, forming the indentation of a man. The mimetic polyalloy then filled this indentation and solidified, setting its default molecular structure.
The T-1000 was constructed using a new technology developed by Skynet. Each molecule of the T-1000 was a primitive miniaturized version of the total machine. Every molecule had the blueprints programmed into them for all the necessary parts required for construction of the whole T-1000. 
T-1001
Rather than automatically seeking out the primary mass, the detached parts of the T-1001 could operate independently, demonstrated by Weaver keeping a part of herself separate in the form of a pet eel.
The T-1001 was extremely adept at terminating multiple fleeing targets with deadly efficiency. It chased down a dozen employees in a secret warehouse, extending blades to at least 10ft to impale the escaping workers. The T-1001 could extend a blade and retract it again with amazing speed, suggesting a remarkable level of control over the structure of its design.
At least one unit possessed more advanced interpersonal skills than other Terminator units.

Like the T-950, the Model T-X is capable of moving its joints in ways that would be impossible for any human or older models of endoskeleton-based Terminators to do. Aided by artificial liquid steel lubrication, each joint has a massive degree of rotation. The neck is capable of 360-degree rotation, and the torso is capable of at least 180-degree rotation.
The Model T-X is capable of easily crushing a human spinal column with just two fingers, and its thighs can crush with a pressure greater than an industrial hydraulic press. Its steel jaws and alloy teeth are harder than industrial diamonds and can crush and cut through titanium, let alone human muscle and bone.
Like the T-1000, the T-X utilizes mimetic polyalloy to impersonate. However, whereas the T-1000 was constructed entirely from this liquid metal, the Model T-X only has a liquid metal outer sheath covering its endoskeleton for infiltration purposes, which gives the T-1000 an advantage for being able to regenerate better. Additionally, the T-X cannot slide through narrow spaces as a T-1000 can. Like the T-1000, the T-X can impersonate any human it touches, typically terminating the subject upon assimilation. The T-X seems to be able to mimic targets it sees as well. For example, the T-X can increase its breast size as seen by a nearby billboard, effectively confusing an L.A. patrolman. Stored within small reservoirs in the cranial casing of the T-X when in endoskeletal form, the mimetic polyalloy not only aids in infiltration, but also adds strength to the overall armor of the Model T-X.
Aside from its increased strength and armor, the Model T-X is fitted with on-board weapon systems, a mechanism previously used in T-950 Infiltrators. Each weapon is located within a reconfigurable arm, underneath the mimetic polyalloy outer sheath. Within its vast internal arsenal, the T-X possesses many different weapons and tools for different missions or situations.
When deploying a weapon, the outer liquid metal skin of the T-X peels back from the right arm, and the arm reconfigures into the selected weapon.
If an onboard weapon is damaged, a T-X is capable of repairing and modifying it.
The weapon can be chosen from XP040 weapon sub window "Weapon Selector" as shown in a T-X's Termovision.
Though it possesses many forms of onboard weapons, the primary weapon of the Model T-X is the plasma cannon. When firing, an electric blue aura forms and intensifies around the weapon as the plasma cannon charges. When fired, a tremendous burst of raw energy, 25 or 30 mm (or about an inch) in diameter is fired from the cannon.The T-X's plasma cannon is a bit more powerful than the typical plasma rifles used by either the Resistance or Skynet and is capable of destroying a small building or an armored vehicle with one shot. in the chest cavity of the T-X takes just seconds to replenish.

The Model T-X is equipped with advanced sensor packages to aid in human identification and termination. These include infrared systems used to pick up heat signatures,, facial recognition, and retina scanning systems. The T-X is also capable of analyzing DNA by sampling a small quantity of its targets blood using sensors housed within its mouth.
The Model T-X possesses detailed files, such as make, model, muzzle velocity, weight, length, cartridge size of a weapon, enabling it use of all military and civilian weaponry;
The Model T-X can access database computers wirelessly via phone lines by emitting a series of eleven beep tones, creating an audible connection, using its voice-processing unit. The T-X's internal communications circuitry also allows radio signals to be broadcast on any frequency, and an on-board navigational system automatically merges with Skynet systems in the area, creating a complete map system which can be displayed on the T-X's heads up display. For safety purposes, the T-X possesses internal diagnosis circuits, and the ability to shunt delicate control circuits to protected areas if a massive voltage is incurred.
The T-X also appears to possess a limited emotional range, which it exhibits even when it is by itself (as opposed to displaying emotions to ingratiate itself with humans). This can be seen during the crane chase when it exhibits frustration and also performs a surprised double take upon realizing the T-850 is still in pursuit. It also seems to feel satisfaction when it smirks after seemingly losing the T-850 and it appears to exhibit a fear response just before the T-850 finally terminates it with one of his hydrogen cores. Also, early in the film when it identifies blood as belonging to "primary target" John Connor, the T-X appears to react with an expression akin to a gasp of excitement.
The T-X is also the only machine to make feral growling noises when angered or frustrated.
Due to being in essence a hybrid of the T-900's endoskeleton and the Mimetic polyalloy used for the T-1000, the T-X was capable of sustaining extreme amounts of damage that no other unit has been known to survive.

The Cyber Research Systems Model T-X, Unlike the T-1000 Advanced Prototype, which is entirely made with mimetic polyalloy, the T-X is an advanced Endoskeleton originating from the T-900, protected by malleable ceramic-titanium armor and covered by mimetic polyalloy. The resultant T-X is stronger than previous Terminator models effectively rendering them redundant.

Sergeant Kyle Reese is a Resistance soldier from the Tech-Com, serial number DN38416. From 2021 to 2027, he served with the 132nd under Justin Perry. In 2027, he joined the leader of the Resistance, John Connor's Tech-Com fighting unit, where he was assigned recon/security. Coming to view John as a surrogate father, in the year 2029, he was sent back in time to the year 1984 to protect John's mother Sarah Connor from a T-800 Model 101 Terminator. Kyle Reese ultimately becomes the biological father of John Connor himself through a predestination paradox.
Kyle Reese was born during or after the first wars around 2003, to Dennis Reese and Mary Shea. Reese was one of the last remaining humans who achieved a victory over the machines.
He survived the capture and killing of his fellow humans only to serve as a slave in one of Skynet's concentration camps, where he and others were forced to load huge numbers of dead bodies into Skynet's furnaces to be incinerated. Reese's freedom would come when a Tech-Com, a resistance movement, led by John Connor (whom Reese would unwittingly father during his journey to the past and ironically consider his closest friend), freed him and the others from Skynet. After leaving the camps, Reese served in the 132nd division under Justin Perry from 2021 to 2027 up to the end of , before transferring as a sergeant to Tech-Com under John Connor himself. John Connor and the resistance would eventually rally enough remaining humans and resources to launch an assault on Skynet.
The final assault would eventually allow the human resistance to cripple Skynet. The Resistance was able to smash Skynet's defense grid allowing them to enter Skynet's main complex and attempt to destroy it. Skynet however would have a final move left: using time displacement equipment, Skynet would send one of its most feared machines (the Terminator) back to Thursday, May 12, 1984, to kill the young Sarah Connor, known to have been the eventual mother of John Connor, the leader of the Resistance, and thus prevent the birth of Connor and his future rebellion. The Terminator The Terminator: Dawn of Fate
Realizing what Skynet was attempting to do, John Connor sends a soldier to protect himself from the machine menace. It would be Reese who would volunteer himself to go back. Once Reese had gone through, the time travel equipment would be destroyed, leaving only Reese and the Terminator in 1984.
Arriving unarmed and not knowing what the Terminator looks like in its disguise, Reese quickly dresses, arms himself with a shotgun and sets out to track the woman he has been assigned to protect. After finally tracking Sarah to a club at the same time as the Terminator, he rescues her and in the ensuing chase, introduces himself and tells Sarah the reason why the Terminator is hunting her, the impending doom of the human race and the future significance carried by her and her unborn son, but they are subsequently captured by the police after the Terminator's car crashes and Sarah and Kyle are surrounded. With the Terminator having fled the scene, Reese is questioned by criminal psychiatrist Dr Peter Silberman, who puts Reese's story of the Terminator and the Future War down as nothing more than a psychotic delusion, although complimenting the scale of it due to the explanations for the lack of future technology. Although Sarah briefly doubts Reese herself, when the Terminator attacks again, Reese manages to escape and retrieve Sarah while the Terminator tears through the station staff.
Having grown up in the future where the machines had all but wiped out the human race, Reese is both physically and mentally hardened. His body is scarred from numerous battles with Skynet, and he has a number of burns as a result of the time travel process. In a deleted scene, when he tries to stop Sarah from going to Cyberdyne Systems, he sees something he has never seen before, what the world looks like before the War Against the Machines. He says he thinks of it as a dream, the trees and stream, the flowers, and Sarah, all beautiful. Bursting into tears, he confesses that it hurts, because he wasn't meant to see this. He then agrees with Sarah that they should try to change the future.
Though hard and battle weary, Reese had a love for Sarah despite having never met and only through a photo could identify. The affection Reese felt for Sarah was based on the legend that surrounded her and on the image of her from the photograph given to him by John Connor. Though initially hostile towards Reese, Sarah grows to trust and love him as he becomes the only thing between her and the Terminator. On the run from the Terminator, Reese and Sarah share a night of intimacy, in which her future son and human leader John Connor is conceived.
However, Reese's life is cut short when both he and Sarah are forced to confront the Terminator. A chase ensues with the Terminator following first on a motorcycle and then in a semi-tanker truck. During the chase, Reese is hit by gunfire. After apparently thinking that they destroyed the Terminator, they run to an automated factory, later revealed to be owned by Cyberdyne Systems where the now-metal endoskeleton of the Terminator pursues them inside. Kyle turns on all the equipment as cover while the Terminator batters its way through the door.
After Sarah accidentally turns on a machine, their hiding place is discovered and the Terminator finds them. After reaching the stairs of a crawlway, Reese tells Sarah to run for cover while Kyle tries to beat the Terminator with a metal rod. The Terminator throws Kyle to the floor, and Reese reaches for a pipe bomb and lights it up, placing it into the Terminator's abdomen. The Terminator explodes except for its lower midsection and Reese rolls down a metal stairway head first. A short time later, after Sarah removes a piece of shrapnel from her leg, she crawls to the motionless Kyle, who has died from his wounds.
Sarah mourns him briefly before the still-functioning Terminator's midsection begins to chase her again. Sarah then crushes the Terminator in a mechanical press (ironically, the machine she triggered that alerted the Terminator to their location earlier) and later tearfully sees Reese's dead body being zipped up in a body bag and taken away. Although Reese died not knowing Sarah was carrying his son that was his future commander, his strength and courage gives Sarah enough for her to teach her unborn son for the pending future he will bring.
By impregnating Sarah with John, Kyle created a predestination paradox in the same way that the discovery of the Terminator's remains in the factory gave birth to Skynet. The Terminator
"Your son gave me a message to give to you. Made me memorize it. Thank you, Sarah, for your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to say that the future is not set. You must be stronger than you imagine you can be. You must survive or I will never exist. That's all." The Terminator

, is a legendary figure and the mother of John Connor, the leader of the Resistance during the Future War, as well as teaching him in the ways of war. She was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.
Sarah Connor was born in 1965 to a waitress mother and a veteran father. As a child, her father walked out on her and her mother. Sarah Connor lived a normal life when growing up. At the age of 19, she studied 
During the Future War, Sarah Connor had become a legendary figure, who taught her son John to fight and organize, preparing him for the coming War.
Sarah Connor lived an ordinary life. However, everything Sarah had ever known was to change on May 12th, 1984. Sarah found herself pursued by a relentless cyborg killer, the Terminator; a Series 800 Model 101 Infiltrator unit for reasons completely unknown to her.
She was rescued from the Terminator by time-traveling soldier Kyle Reese, who explained that in the future, an artificial intelligence called Skynet would be created by military software developers to make strategic decisions. The program became self-aware, seized control of most of the world's military hardware, including various highly-advanced robots, and launched an all-out attack on human beings — the Judgment Day. However, a man named John Connor eventually led the human Resistance group Tech-Com to victory, only to discover that in a last-ditch effort, Skynet had developed a time travel mechanism and sent a robot killer back in time in an effort to destroy John Connor's family before he could be born. John Connor was Sarah's future son, and Connor sent back a trusted soldier, Reese, to protect his mother at all costs. During their brief time together, Sarah fell in love with Reese. Reese became the only hope protecting her from the Terminator and her only companion as they fled together.
The Terminator killed a number of people in order to get to Sarah Connor, including two other women in the Los Angeles area who shared her name, her mother and Ginger. Initially, she was unaware that Reese himself had been in love with her from afar, having been given a picture of her by John Connor, and having always admired her legendary strength and resilience. They shared a night of intimacy that resulted in the conception of John. Their relationship was cut short when Reese died fighting the Terminator in a Cyberdyne factory; Sarah, in turn, crushed the Terminator in a hydraulic press.
Though Reese's death deeply saddened her, his sincerity and courage inspired Sarah to carry on and develop the necessary skills and abilities that would make her a suitable mentor and teacher to John. The Terminator
Terminator 2: 
Going into hiding, Sarah gave birth to John on February 28, 1985, and immediately entered into a mostly fugitive lifestyle, beginning his training and learning from whoever would teach them. The two lived as nomads, spending a lot of time in South and Central America. It was not until she attempted to blow up the local offices of some computer corporation back in Los Angeles, getting herself caught by the police that she was seen again by the authorities. Upon trying to warn of the impending Judgment Day, Sarah was handed over to the custody of Dr. Peter Silberman at the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, a prison facility charged with the care and interment of people with mental problems. She was diagnosed with acute schizo-affective disorder and institutionalized, her son John being put into foster care.
When Sarah was 29 years old, another Terminator, this time a T-1000, was sent back to eliminate Sarah's 10-year-old son John. Sarah broke out of her cell and neutralized Douglas by breaking his nose with a broken broom handle. She then knocked out another staff member and broke Dr. Silberman's arm, threatening to poison him to get the other staff to release her by unlocking the security doors. However, a backup member released Silberman and Sarah escaped to the elevators, while the staff desperately chased her all the way.
Sarah quickly ran to the elevator bank, waiting anxiously. Just then, the second T-800 exited the elevator. Sarah recognized her old enemy and ran in absolute terror as she believes the Terminator was there for the same reason as the T-800 back in 1984 — to kill her and John. John exited the elevator and run after her. The staff caught up and restrained Sarah while Dr. Silberman attempted to sedate her. However, before they could the T-800 incapacitates them all, except Silberman, on John's orders.
With the help of her son, and the reprogrammed 800 Series Terminator sent back in time to protect him, Sarah broke out of Pescadero. Sarah, John, and the T-800 fled toward Mexico, meeting up with Sarah's gun-running friend Enrique Salceda and his family. Enrique had been taking care of an underground bunker filled with Sarah's weapons. Trying to prevent Judgment Day, Sarah found out about Skynet's construction by Miles Dyson from the T-800 termanator and set out to eliminate him. Although she found herself unable to simply murder him in cold blood, she helped convince Dyson to stop work on Skynet and destroy all his files and the Cyberdyne Systems building. Upon the destruction of Cyberdyne, which resulted in Dyson's death, and the destruction of both Terminators, Sarah took John back into hiding, continuing to train him to become the great military leader and tactician he would be in the future. Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Because Sarah, John, and the T-800 successfully destroyed the laboratory of Cyberdyne Systems, the Judgment Day never occurs. In the year 2027, John Connor is a U.S. Senator and has a child of his own. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (alternative ending)

The Film Franchise
According to the script for The Terminator in the Special Edition DVD, Sarah was 19 years old. The film was set from May 12 through May 14 of 1984, placing her birth date between 1964-5-15 and 1965-5-12.
In Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Sarah's psychologist states that she is 29. The film itself takes place on a summer weekend when John (born 1985-2-28) is age 10, setting the date of T2 between 1995-06-21 and 1995-09-23. This places Sarah's birth date between 1965-06-22 and 1966-09-23, making her 17 or 18 during The Terminator.
The ending credits of Terminator: Dark Fate state that Sarah was 33 years old in the opening scene of the film, which takes place in 1998. This suggests that Sarah was born in either 1964 or 1965.
There is no overlap in the date ranges suggested by the first two films, thus one of the stated ages must be incorrect. If we assume Sarah was 18 during The Terminator, 19 when John was born, and 29 during the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, then this places Sarah's date of birth between 22 June 1965 and 28 February 1966. It is also been highly speculated that Sarah's exact date of birth is 13 November 1965.
The tombstone shown in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) reads 1959–1997. The birth year would make her 24 or 25 during The Terminator. Her death was described as from leukemia shortly after the original Judgment Day (1997-8-29). It is argued that she and John were living "off the grid" in her adult years, routinely using false names, birth dates, inter alias; and that her tomb was really a weapons cache. Nevertheless, the age of John in Rise of Machines timeline(s) shows an inconsistency with other timelines.
For comparison, Linda Hamilton was born in September 1956, three years before 1959, the year given for Sarah's birth in T3.
Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles
The timeline in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles is different from that in the films. In the SCC timeline, the events of The Terminator take place in February 1983, and those of Terminator 2: Judgment Day in 1997.
In the Pilot episode, Sarah's FBI file lists her age as 33 on 1999-08-24, placing her birth date between 1965-08-25 and 1966-08-24. This would make her 16 or 17 during The Terminator.
In the episode Strange Things Happen at the One Two Point, Sarah states that she was 19 when John was born. John's birth date in this timeline is 1983-11-14, thus placing Sarah's birth date between 1963-11-15 and 1964-11-14.
Since these is no overlap in the above date ranges, one of the stated ages must be incorrect. If we assume Sarah was 18 during The Terminator and 19 when John was born (same as in the films), then Sarah would have been born in 1964 sometime between February (exact day unknown) and 14 November. Her age in the Pilot would be 34 or 35, depending on whether she was born before or after 24 August.
For comparison, Lena Headey was born in October 1973, making her 33 at the start of filming in January 2007, and the same age Sarah is said to be in 1999.
Sarah'
In the original timeline as mentioned in the novelization of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Sarah Connor dies when John Connor is in his mid-twenties when a supply convoy from Mexico led by her is ambushed by a squad of HKs.
The alternate ending for Terminator 2: Judgment Day in the Ultimate Edition DVD shows Sarah alive and well on August 29, 2029. She is by then a grandmother (and John is a Senator) in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity.
The Sarah Connor Chronicles timeline establishes that Sarah would have died of cancer in 2005 if she hadn't jumped forward to 2007. Therefore, if she does not receive treatment (or a cure) for her condition, she can expect to die sometime in 2013, assuming the time travel or other factors related to the relocation does not affect the progress of the disease. This bears some similarity to the Rise of the Machines version of Sarah, who also dies sometime after the original date (29 August 1997) of Judgment Day.

John Connor, the son of Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese, is the leader of the worldwide human Resistance, as well as the more specialised Tech-Com during the War Against the Machines. Skynet, the supercomputer mainframe of the machines, decides that John Connor is the focal point of the rebellion and his termination would end the opposition. After repeated failures at terminating John during the war, Skynet decides to use a time displacement device to send Terminators to various points in the past in an attempt to terminate him before the war even begins.
John Connor was born on February 28, 1985, to Sarah Connor and his unnamed father. On the brink of extinction in 1997, John Connor united the despairing humans and taught them to fight, storm the camps and overcome the Terminator guards. Much of the Resistance was created from these survivors. The Terminator
He led the human Resistance to the victory in the War against the Machines in the year 2029. In order to eliminate John Connor, Skynet sent a T-800 and a T-1000 to the past to kill John's mother, Sarah, and young John Connor respectively via Time Displacement Equipment. Thus, John sends Kyle Reese, a young soldier, and a reprogrammed Series 800 Terminator to the past to protect Sarah Connor and young John Connor respectively. The Terminator Terminator 2: Judgment Day The Terminator: Dawn of Fate Terminator: Resistance
John Connor was born to Sarah Connor on February 28, 1985. His father, Kyle Reese, had been killed nine months prior in May 1984, protecting Sarah from a time-traveling Terminator. John's early life was filled with training by various persons his mother Sarah had met as the two lived off the grid after the attempt on her life by the Terminator. Much of his training concentrated on the areas of weaponry, computer technology, and espionage.
When Sarah Connor was shot and captured after trying to blow up a computer factory in the early 1990s, John was placed into foster care and told that his mother's stories of the future were merely delusions. He was unable to cope with life in suburbia and rebelled, edging towards delinquency, turning into a young gangster and receiving a police record (which included trespassing, shoplifting, disturbing the peace, and vandalism) by the time he was 10 years old. His foster parents, Todd and Janelle Voight, found themselves unable to deal with him, and were not surprised when a police officer showed up at their door asking to speak with John.
John's life was changed in a matter of seconds, when a T-1000 came back from the year 2029, programmed to assassinate him. A T-800 (whom John later nicknamed "Uncle Bob") had also come back in time, this one programmed to protect him. John, now believing his mother's stories, used the protecting T-800 to release his mother from the maximum security prison Pescadero State Hospital. The three then proceeded to seek out Miles Dyson, the would-be creator of the neural-net processor, in an attempt to stop Judgment Day from occurring. During their time together John bonds with the T-800, who becomes a friend and father figure to him. Once the T-1000 is destroyed along with all of Cyberdyne's research, the T-800 asks that it be destroyed also so that its technology would not be discovered and used by others. Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Because Sarah, John, and the T-800 successfully destroyed the laboratory of Cyberdyne Systems, Skynet is never created and Judgment Day never occurs. In the year 2027, John Connor is a U.S. Senator and has a child. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (alternative ending)
The fact that Kyle Reese is John Connor's father creates a paradox: John must send Kyle back in time so that he can exist in order to defeat Skynet and send Kyle back to protect his mother in the first place. But this opens up the potential that John may have had another father, as otherwise he would not have existed in the original timeline (i.e. a timeline prior to TDE existing). This leads many fans to one of several theories:
In Terminator: Genisys, it's confirmed that Kyle was John's father the whole time. John knew this when he sent Kyle back and Sarah suggests he manipulated Kyle to ensure his own existence. In this timeline, Sarah was also aware of this fact due to the Guardian.
In Terminator: Dark Fate, John is no longer the leader of the future Resistance since the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day changed the future and prevented Skynet from being created. Instead, Dani Ramos is the future leader of the Resistance against the artificial intelligence Legion.

Dr. Miles Bennett Dyson was the original inventor of the neural-net processor which would lead to the development of Skynet, a computer A.I. intended to control electronically linked weapons and defend the United States, but which would later become self-aware and launch a global war of extermination against humanity. Through his research, he unintentionally became the man most responsible for Judgement Day and the near-extinction of mankind. However, his intentions were never malicious, and he did all in his power to prevent the consequences of his mistakes.
Miles was married to Tarissa Dyson, with whom he had two children, Danny and Blythe.
Growing up in Detroit, Miles Dyson first aspired to be a professional athlete. Not skilled enough to gain a scholarship, he then turned to technology after scoring high on his math exams.
In 1995, Dr. Dyson had been a cybernetics scientist and a high-ranking employee of Cyberdyne Systems Corporation as Director of Special Projects. He was tasked to create a new neural-net processor from two pieces of unknown-sourced advanced technology. The technology actually came from a ten-year-old crime scene from another Cyberdyne facility (The Terminator's arm and CPU). Miles worked on the project around the clock with his colleagues at the main Cyberdyne office, where he was one of the few people who were given access to the original Terminator arm and CPU chip. He also worked at his home office. Miles truly believed in the potential of his work as the processor could lead to a revolutionary new brand of automated systems, as well as a more advanced form of artificial intelligence making other existing computer systems obsolete in comparison. The project eventually reached the point where he nearly completed a prototype of the processor. Had the project been completed and deployed by the nation's military defense network, the processor, named Skynet, would have gained self-awareness and waged a genocidal war on mankind.
Dyson's vision and the creation of Skynet were averted by Sarah Connor, who wished to stop Skynet's attack before it began. Using files from another future Terminator to track down Miles at his home, Sarah initially tried to kill him with a CAR-15 sniper rifle but Miles was momentarily distracted by his son, Danny, narrowly evading the shot, which destroyed his monitor. Sarah switched the rifle to full-auto and opened fire again but Miles took cover behind his desk where the bullets, though completely destroying prototype within his computer along with other equipment, could not injure him. With the rifle magazine empty, Sarah advanced on the house with a .45 caliber side-arm and began shooting at Miles's close-range eventually hitting him in the shoulder and cornering him with his wife, and son.
With a gun to his head, Miles pleaded with Sarah what she wanted from him. Sarah, in an enraged state, blamed him for everything that was to transpire without any full explanation, only prompting Miles to utter an innocent "...what?" Sarah broke down emotionally and could not bring herself to kill Miles in front of his wife and children when he was not even responsible for anything yet. Sarah's son John and the second Terminator arrived at that moment hoping to stop Sarah from committing murder. John went to his mother while the Terminator examined Mile's shoulder wound. Miles then asked his attackers to identify themselves, not expecting the Terminator to cut the flesh from his arm and expose its robotic nature. Dr. Dyson was speechless at the revelation that this man was actually a machine from the future and identical to the components that brought about his technical achievements at Cyberdyne.
After Miles's wound was tended to and the shock of the attack had died down, Sarah and the company began to explain Skynet's future and its true effects on humanity. Remarking that he suddenly felt ill at the thought of his work leading to an apocalyptic future, Miles was convinced to quit Cyberdyne and said he would destroy all of his work. However, the Terminator made him realize that as long as the laboratory and technological artifacts at Cyberdyne were intact Skynet could still be created by others following his footsteps. Miles then agreed to go to the Cyberdyne building with the Connors and the Terminator to destroy all his research and also sent his family into hiding. Before leaving, Tarissa agreed with Miles that Skynet had to be destroyed above all else and bid him good luck.
Miles initially hoped to enter the building undeterred and destroy the contents of the lab without opposition. However, the guard refused due to the late hour of the night and lack of proper paper-work which needed filing prior to access. Instead, the group forced their way in at gunpoint, binding and gagging the guard in the lobby men's room and, after Miles helped John gather the advanced technological artifacts of the original Terminator from the high-security lab, began preparing to destroy the entire laboratory itself with a massive bomb consisting of polydichloric euthimal. Just as the bomb was ready, multiple SWAT team officers arrived in response to the break-in and one unit stormed the building. The team opened fire and Miles was riddled with bullet-wounds before he took cover.
Gravely injured, Miles desperately bid the others escape and stayed behind to trigger the bombs' remote, which would be flipped by a large fragment of his Neural Net Processor model, which Miles held over the trigger button. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the SWAT team promptly evacuated. Miles slowly succumbed to his injuries with heartfelt and shallow breathing, losing the strength to hold the model over the trigger. As his hand dropped the bomb detonated with a massive fireball, killing Miles and destroying the lab and a sizable portion of Cyberdyne Headquarters.
Sarah became a fugitive because she has been blamed for Miles's death. It was revealed that his work has been used to create John Henry and another unknown Artificial intelligence.
After the Judgment Day, the South Division scientific doctor Edwin Mack find some of Skynet's original programming written by Dyson, and within a vulnerability, or "Zero Exploit". Impressed by its finding, Mack, under orders of John Connor, was able to upload a virus which alternated the Machines' "behavior", delaying the advance of Annihilation Line, and gaining the Resistance a critical time to finally win the war.
Miles Dyson is still alive, due to the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day never happening from the altered timeline. His son, Daniel Dyson, is the chief of development for Genisys.

Judgment Day, also known as J-, refers to the day that the artificial intelligence —Skynet— becomes self-aware and starts a nuclear war on the United States of America, Russia, and other places, killing three billion people.
Sarah Connor first learned about Judgment Day in 1984 from Kyle Reese, a soldier sent from the future to protect her from an assassination mission by a Terminator. The Terminator
Due to the impact of time travel on the Terminator timelines, the date of Judgment Day has been altered several times.
1995
In one of the timelines, Judgment Day occurred in 1995, much earlier than it originally is. The Terminator: Future Shock
1997
The first specific date of Judgment Day as described by both Sarah Connor and the T-800 occurs on August 29, 1997. Skynet becomes self-aware at 02:14 am Eastern Time after its activation on August 4, 1997 and launches nuclear missiles at Russia to incite a counterattack against the humans who, in a panic, tried to disconnect it. Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Since Sarah and the Terminator both share the same information (which it would in any case if both it and Kyle were sent back at the same time to different destinations. T2: The Future War), this date has not changed as a result of Cyberdyne managing to reconstruct and create the Terminators from the remaining parts of the T-800 sent to 1984 from the future. At this stage, quality may have improved, but the timing has not yet changed.
2003
In Russia, a routine day at sea turns into a nightmare when it seems the US has launched a massive nuclear attack on the rest of the world. Terminator Salvation: Dark Sky
2004
After Sarah Сonnor, her son John and the T-800 destroy Cyberdyne headquarters and all backups of the research Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the date for Judgment Day is moved to July 25, 2004 6:18 pm Eastern Time. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.
This event is not prevented, and occurs as predicted with the T-850 indicating "Judgment Day is inevitable". Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines
2000
After John Connor and Wendy Dorset inadvertently participated in the creation of Skynet while attempting to stop Clea Bennet in 2002, T2: Rising Storm the date for Judgment Day was altered into a progressively developing scenario of machine-based homicidal mania that takes years to develop until the full fledged nuclear strikes of Judgment Day now occurred sometime in early 2000s when it executed the program Firefall. T2: The Future War
This sequence of events was directly attributable to the temporal intervention by Skynet and the deployment of the I-950 Infiltrator Serena Burns to ensure Skynet's creation as well as Dr. Kurt Viemeister's involvement. .
2011
Cameron tells Sarah in 2007 that Judgment Day is now set to occur on April 21, 2011. Skynet is destined to go online a few days earlier, on April 19, 2011. Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles "Pilot"
2017
As a result of an assassination attempt on Sarah Connor's life in 1973, she has a T-800 known as the Guardian as her protector. When the T-800 arrives to assassinate her in 1984, it is confronted by Guardian almost immediately and deactivated by Sarah with a .50 caliber round to its power cell. Though its later reactivated by the T-1000, it is once again deactivated by Kyle Reese blowing its head off. The T-800 is dissolved in acid and its CPU used to act as the crude version of the Time Displacement Equipment's operating system at which point it burns out and is presumably destroyed by Guardian. As a result of the total destruction of the T-800, Cyberdyne doesn't get its CPU to study, Skynet is not created and Judgment Day does not occur in 1997 and is postponed to 2017 which Kyle learns due to the memories of the new timeline he received while time traveling. In this new timeline, after being converted into a T-3000 by Alex, John Connor is sent back to 2014 where he helps Cyberdyne build Genisys, an operating system that when activated, will control and connect all worldwide hardware, including military hardware. Genisys is actually Skynet in a new form and once it comes online, Judgment Day will begin. Kyle, Sarah and Guardian work to stop it and destroy Genisys before it fully comes online. They are hampered in their efforts by John, but assault Cyberdyne anyway, resulting in John pushing up Genisys' activation from thirteen hours to fifteen minutes. Despite John's best efforts, the three destroy the facility and apparently Skynet. Judgment Day is averted, but unknown to them, Skynet's system core survives underground and it becomes self-aware. It is likely that Judgment Day has just been postponed to another time as a result. Terminator Genisys
2020
In Jade's World, Skynet became self-aware in 2021. It launched attacks on humanity on 18 June, resulting in Judgment Day.
In the Dark Fate timeline, after the termination of Skynet and the destruction of a Cyberdyne building, a new timeline was created, in which Judgment Day happened in the 2020s. In this timeline, a different AI, Legion, was responsible for the new Judgment Day, which it began by cutting humanity off from necessary utilities and electronics. Terminator: Dark Fate

The Resistance is one of the two primary factions in the Future War; it is a military force that fights against Skynet after Judgment Day. It is composed of an alliance of surviving professional military units and surviving militias from all nations around the world. It is led by John Connor, whom Skynet has been trying to eliminate from the timeline to prevent the creation of the Resistance. Its main purpose was to fight the Skynet and its machines, as well as preserving the human race from total annihilation. The Resistance carried out many combat missions, attacking factories and rescue humans out of Skynet Work Camps. To even the odds, they capture weapons from Skynet force and reprogram Terminators to aid in the struggle. The symbol of the Resistance is a red Double Helix (the shape of DNA).
With the date of Judgment Day changing, no date can be set as to when the Resistance was formed. Though, it can be inferred that it started soon after Judgment Day took place.
On the brink of extinction, John Connor united the despairing humans and taught them to fight, storm the camps, and overcome the Terminator guards. Much of the Resistance was created from these survivors.
In 2029, the Resistance raided the Skynet Core in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, smashing its defense grid and destroying the Skynet Core. However, in a last ditch effort before its destruction, Skynet sent a T-800 Terminator and a T-1000 Prototype traveling back to the year 1984 and 1995 through the Time Displacement Equipment to assassinate Sarah Connor and young John Connor respectively in order to erase John Connor from the timeline. Sergeant Kyle Reese, a Resistance soldier, volunteer to travel to 1984 in order to save Sarah Connor.
In the Rise of the Machine timeline, which was created due to the destruction of the Cyberdyne Building, the core of the Resistance was possibly formed from the remnants of the United States military, with Lieutenant General Robert Brewster as one of the key figures along with John Connor. 
However, in 2032, Skynet sent a T-X Terminatrix to the year 2004 through Continuum Transporter in order to assassinate key figures of the Resistance, including Robert Brewster, Kate Brewster, Jose Barrera, the Anderson Siblings, Simon Taylor, Isaac Hall, Fritz Roland, Ted Snavely, Sharlene Gen, and Vince Forcer. Additionally, Skynet sent a T-850 to assassinate John Connor and the Infiltrator succeeded in its mission before it was captured by the Resistance. The Resistance then had the T-850 sent back to 2004 to protect the young John Connor and Kate Brewster.
In the Salvation timeline, the core of the Resistance was founded from the remnants of the world's military forces, who were then joined by other survivors, including General Hugh Ashdown from United States military and General Dmitri Losenko from the Russian Armed Forces.
During the Future War, the chief officers of the Resistance led from the USS Wilmington, a Los Angeles-class submarine serving as Resistance Headquarters, in the form of a leading council of Generals and Admirals, with General Ashdown assuming the leading role. However, the group were killed just before the assault on Skynet Central when the USS Wilmington was located and destroyed by a HK-Aerial.
Sometime after the incident, John Connor had assumed command of the Resistance. During 2029, John Connor led an assault on a Skynet Base in Colorado. 
After Skynet was endangered by its own tactical error as it utilized the psychopath serial killer Thomas Parnell as its henchman,
In the Dark Fate timeline, which was created due to the destruction of the Cyberdyne Building and Skynet was erased from the timeline, Legion, an artificial intelligence created for cybernetic warfare, initiated an attack on humanity, leading to the War against the Machines.
After Judgment Day, Dani Ramos began to gathering survivors and grouped them into a Resistance in order to fight against Legion.
In 2042, the Resistance captured a TD Chamber, neutralizing every enemy within the chamber. However, they found that a Rev-9 had been sent back in time to 2020 to kill the younger Dani Ramos. Grace Harper, an Augment who was saved by Ramos when she was young, volunteered for the time travel mission to 2020 to protect the younger Dani Ramos.
The Resistance is composed of combat units scattered across the world, all answering to the allied commander. A staff assists the allied commander in strategy, planning and preparation. Communication between units is usually by encrypted communications.
Weapons, 
After Judgment Day, when Skynet's robotic forces began to kill off the surviving humans, the former human military forces began to fight back. In the case of the United States, as well as the remnants of many other large and well-equipped countries, they use former military weapons, uniforms, body armor, vehicles and aircraft in combination with newer plasma based energy weapons (copied, stolen or produced in captured Skynet factories) that were used to fight Skynet worldwide. Some tactics were conventional, like Airborne Helicopter assaults, and others, like "Hit and Run" attacks, were also used by Resistance forces.
The many years John Connor was trained by Sarah Connor, his mother, in the South and Central Americas has helped John in many ways, not just because of the combat skills he learned, but the lifestyles and tactics as well. When John and his mother were training/hiding in Latin America, Sarah sought out any and everyone that could help teach her son. In the process, John and Sarah ended up living, training and fighting with many groups of guerrillas, paramilitary forces and freedom fighter-all of whom had extensive knowledge of fighting a larger, more numerous and better-armed central enemy/government. The skills acquired by John in these various theaters of operations, in combination with tactics he learned from ex-U.S. Special Operations Force and British SAS personnel (whom his mother dated or he met after Judgment Day), his mother and his own personal combat-oriented genius have allowed him to wage many styles of war (both conventional and unconventional) on Skynet and its machines.
Humans who did not join the military remnants became known as "Survivalists" who often ran and hid when confronted by Skynet, rather than fight. Others who took up arms often pretended to be in the Resistance, but rather, took advantage of other survivors, such as in gangs and thieves. The first group was considered civilians by the Resistance, while the second was considered renegades. The civilians were considered to be left alone, or in certain cases had been allied with the Resistance, scrounging for food or other essential goods. The renegades were also to be left alone, as the main focus was on Skynet. Only in cases in being trapped by an aggressive renegade were Resisitance members to invoke human-on-human fighting,
In some timelines, many humans have betrayed their own kind in order to work for Skynet as collaborators, being allowed, as a reward from the machines, to roam free at anytime, or be sent back in time to enjoy the pre-Judgment Day world.

The Infiltrator is a type of Terminator that features a human appearance, created by Skynet to mimic humans and infiltrate the Resistance.
An Infiltrator is usually a Humanoid Terminator with an outer sheath of human appearance, in order for a machine to infiltrate human groups.
If the CPU is set to read-write, an Infiltrator can become more human-like and even blend in human society. 
Some Terminator Series can consume sustenance. Cameron, a T-900 from The Sarah Connor Chronicles timeline, is  The T-888 presumably consumes food, given Vick Chamberlain's ability to maintain a human cover for years while married to a human woman.
The T-600 Terminator was the first Infiltrator developed by Skynet as an attempt to infiltrate the Resistance. However, Skynet used the rubber skin as the covering sheath for the T-600 Terminator, which made it easy to be spotted by the Resistance.
The T-800 Infiltrator was the first truly successful Infiltrator unit, consisting of living tissue over a metal endoskeleton. Such Infiltrator features every human feature, including hair, blood, tear, sweat and bad breath. Some of the units can even highly mimic human emotion and behaviors, such as Carl.
Later, Skynet developed new series of the Infiltrator based on mimetic polyalloy, allowing the units to impersonate any person molecularly sampled by physical contact. The first Infiltrator series with mimetic polyalloy is the T-1000 Terminator and its variants, such as T-1001 and T-XA. Those series are entirely composed of mimetic polyalloy, so they are capable of altering its form and appearance into any person or object of similar volume.
In the Rise of the Machines timeline, Skynet created the T-X Terminatrix, which used mimetic polyalloy as outer sheath over an advanced metal endoskeleton that featured various onboard weapons, such as plasma weaponry and flamethrower. In the Dark Fate timeline, Legion applied a similar design concept to develop Rev-9, an Infiltrator made of a carbon-based endoskeleton covered by mimetic polyalloy, able to separate into two units. Rev-9 featured a more convincing human behavior mimicry.
The T-799 "Eve" was the first Infiltrator prototype with living tissue over a metal endoskeleton in The New John Connor Chronicles timeline.
In the Salvation timeline, Skynet used the research from Cyberdyne Systems to create T-H Hybrid Human as the Infiltration Prototype before it could develop the Terminator Resistance Infiltrator Prototype (T-RIP). Near the end of Future War, Skynet developed New Terminator, which was able to mimic human emotion, and even thinking about the concept of aesthetics.
Additional research was put forward into increasingly-organic Terminators able to more efficiently evade detection and infiltrate human organizations, such as the TS-300 Stealth Terminator created by MIR, the T-900, and the I-950 Infiltrator.
TS-300 
Additional to the ceramic endoskeleton mimicking human weight and structure for scans, the TS-300 Stealth Terminator uses personality transfer software called "Stealth Infiltrator Personality" to create undetectable one-off copies of real human beings. The TS-300 is equipped with the EM sensor masking/stealth unit which enables it to defeat other electronic detection systems as well.
T-900 
Despite being designed without the ceramic endoskeleton, the T-900 Infiltrator from Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles timeline is able to copy and possess the personality, along with the memory, from the target for replacement. In addition, it can highly mimic human behaviors and emotions.
I-950 
Unlike other Terminators, the I-950 Infiltrator from T2 Trilogy timeline was born rather than created with technological enhancements added over time; the I-950 starts out as a baby with a neural net processor attached to the brain, providing an uplink to Skynet. Because of I-950's almost purely-organic nature, it is harder to detect using metal detectors and is undetected by dogs.
T-
In Salvation timeline, Skynet developed T-H Hybrid Human by transferring the brain and organs from a human body to an endoskeleton from the R&D left by Cyberdyne Systems. Thus, a T-H possesses every aspect of a human and is utilized as an Infiltration Prototype.
In Salvation timeline, Skynet developed New Terminators from T-800. A New Terminator features more human emotion and behaviour mimicry than its predecessor, even capable of lying or discussing, debating with humans.
T-3000 
Near the end of the war, Skynet tried to create a new breed of Infiltrator, known as the T-3000, made of humans transformed through exposure to a type of machine phase matter. All of the converted humans went insane and died, however, but Skynet successfully converted John Connor into one T-3000. It had abilities similar to a T-1000 while still retaining his own memory, knowledge and personality, though loyal to Skynet, of his human self, making him able to perfectly blend in with humans. It proved to be nearly impossible to destroy as well.
Non-

Skynet developed the technology to grow living tissue, which is also known as cyborg tissue, to make it become an Infiltrator, allowing the machine to infiltrate the Resistance, as well as generate the bio-electric field necessary to send Terminator units to the past from the future.
In the original timeline, Terminators were originally purely robotic and were not covered with living tissue. Starting with the T-600 Terminator, Skynet tried to cover the endoskeleton with rubber skin, which looked fake and was easily spotted. Skynet discovered a method that allowed them to grow living tissue over the endoskeleton, making the new Terminators almost impossible to spot. Since then, Skynet successfully developed the T-800 Terminator, which is the first truly successful Infiltrator unit, consisting of living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
In The Terminator: Enemy of my Enemy, living tissue was based on Dr. Elise Fong's research, which was developed as artificial skin for burn victims. It then became the precursor to living tissue. To prevent the artificial skin from growing like cancer, Dr. Fong designed a control mechanism based on a virus as a kill switch for when in case there is anything going wrong, the virus will necrotize the skin, making the growth deactivate itself.
In Skynet's World, the T-799 was the first Terminator with living tissue.
In the Salvation timeline, the development of living tissue was part of Project Angel and funded by the government in hope to help with battlefield injuries. This leads to the T-H Hybrid Humans, the first Terminator Series featuring living tissue before the T-800 was developed, being more convincingly human at the cost of having mostly unprotected human organs that can easily get targeted.
In The Terminator RPG timeline, Skynet goes through three generations of living tissue: necrotizing tissue (flesh that decays unless constantly bathed in nutrition fluids)
Since living tissue is the same as the real tissue on humans, it is able to bleed, sweat, breathe, produce realistic body odor,
Although Terminator flesh does contain blood, it only displays minimal bleeding when damaged and has never been shown to experience any kind of profuse bleeding, even from massive lacerations and dozens of gunshot wounds.
It is unknown what manner of circulatory system, if any, is employed, nor what biological processes take place to sustain the flesh covering.
In the original timeline, the early version of living tissue can necrotize if damaged after being shot multiple times. Following the shootout in the police station, the original T-800's skin had a noticeably waxy, corpse-like pale color and flies were sitting on its face. This drew an inquiry from Rodney, the janitor of the building the T-800 used as a safe house, as to whether the smell was coming from a dead animal. Hence, the early version of living tissue, apparently, may "die" or at least undergo extensive necrosis.
When the T-800 was having bullets removed from his back, it explained that the wounds would heal over time. The Guardian's outer sheath of its right arm was destroyed by acid, but the tissue was fully regrown after years as was the damage to the living tissue on his face. Flesh lacerations can be "repaired".
The sheaths used on the T-888 Infiltrators from The Sarah Connor Chronicles timeline appear to be noticeably superior to previous models, as there are many instances where the flesh has repaired after extensive damage within a few hours, leaving only scars that would disappear not too long after that. T-888 Infiltrator units are also capable of lasting extended periods. In addition, Myron Stark, a T-888 Infiltrator, had bricked itself inside a wall for over 40 years while its skin was still "alive" and "young". These machines also seem to nourish their organic components through the consumption of certain foods, including mostly carbohydrates.
In the Salvation timeline, a more-advanced living tissue sheath was developed and utilized within a T-H Hybrid Human. As long as the brain is intact, a T-H was capable of regenerating an organ which had been previously removed over time, even when the subject was off-line. The living tissue of T-H will not age nor decay during hibernation.
Guardian's living tissue visibly aged from 1973 to 1984, something Kyle Reese commented on, stating that he had never seen a Terminator look so old. From 1984 and 2017, the Guardian's living tissue had aged further so he had a more elderly appearance, including white hair.
The process of growing living tissue on Terminators is made by surrounding the endoskeleton with a special liquid of synthetic blood plasma, which is done in industrial facilities of Skynet. The human-based cyborg Dudley, formerly an ER trauma surgeon and combat medic in the Resistance, was made into a mobile field unit for the maintenance of Skynet's newly perfected T-800 Infiltrator. In their initial fielding, it still took over a year to cultivate a viable human tissue sheath for the infiltration units, and Skynet needed something small and familiar with human tissue, able to maintain the perishable and hard to replace tissue sheaths. Tissue repair (again) became his primary function.
The Terminator endoskeletons are placed inside a mold, which are presumably filled with a liquid possible similar to the one mentioned above, but directly controlled in order to produce finished and natural infiltration sheaths.
T2 
A more refined process was utilized by Serena Burns, an I-950 Infiltrator, in the creation of fully formed T-800 Terminators in the present utilizing a combination of contemporary materials and chemical extracts of her own enhanced blood. Fully formed infiltration sheaths with the Model 101 template were part of the two-month long crafting process in the Secret Terminator Lab.
In some cases, Terminators can grow living tissue by lowering themselves into a synthetic blood plasma bath. This field-expedient method of damaged tissue replacement requires the coercion and compliance of contemporary humans (theoretical hematologists, plastic surgeons), both to produce the synthetic bath, and to shape and refine the finished flesh product, as it is initially quite gruesome. The raw flesh generation and the corrective surgical procedures combined take several days to complete.
There is a device utilized to grow the living tissue over Endoskeleton, which acts like "weaving".
The model of a Terminator, such as the Cyberdyne Systems Model 101, refers to the template of the living tissue sheath which surrounds the Endoskeleton.
It has been shown that Terminator flesh coverings are somehow grown identically, producing many multiple copies of exactly the same physical appearance, indicating the use of specific physical templates for different variations of a model.
In addition to the Model 101, which had been worn by several units, a T-888 model known as "Vick Chamberlain" was also worn by multiple units as Vick had a memory of facing a room (presumably in the factory where it was created) of several dozen units sharing an identical template to itself, naked and moving in unison. Some Terminators' outer sheaths are custom-designed to copy the appearances of humans whom they are intended to kill and replace, such as Carl Greenway,
In order for this time travel to occur, the subject must be a living organism (or must be surrounded by living tissue) in order to generate the bioelectric field needed for the Time Displacement Equipment to operate.
The T-1000 Terminator is wrapped in a cocoon made of living tissue for time travel, while it is unknown if a T-X Terminatrix travels with the same method via the Continuum Transporter or not.
