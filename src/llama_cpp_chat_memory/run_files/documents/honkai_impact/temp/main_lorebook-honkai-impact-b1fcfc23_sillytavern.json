    "description": "onkai Impact 3rd (Chinese: \u5d29\u574f3; pinyin: B\u0113ng Hu\u00e0i 3; lit. 'Collapse 3rd') is a free-to-play 3D action role-playing game (originally a mobile exclusive) developed and published by miHoYo, and later ported to Microsoft Windows. It is the spiritual successor to Houkai Gakuen 2, using many characters from the previous title in a separate story. The game is notable for incorporating a variety of genres, from hack and slash and social simulation, to elements of bullet hell, platforming.\r\n\r\nSirin.\r\nThe beginning of the destruction\r\nIn Houkai world, on the Siberian snowfields, stands the second-largest Houkai-energy Research Facility: the Babylon Laboratory. The Babylon laboratory has the world's third-largest Houkai-capacity Reactor, with a power of up to 6500HW.\r\n\r\nThe Houkai power of the 4th Herrscher was only 2000HW. Such a high-intensity Houkai power can be gathered without Houkai, thanks to extremely tight isolation facilities.\r\n\r\nThere are three departments in Babylon's laboratory, the only one which is mentioned is the Advanced System Division, which disguises itself as a medical institution for the treatment of Honkai energy diseases. However, in reality, it studies the technology that combines Houkai energy with the human body. It experiments on orphaned children and said by Sirin to have abused them.\r\n\r\nAvrora Agata Bella result\r\nAvrora, Agata and Bella's dead bodies from the experiments\r\n\r\nSirin experiment\r\nThe experiment being held on Sirin\r\n\r\nAs one of countless experimental subjects, Sirin was injected with a large amount of Houkai energy by Schicksal researchers, which finally condensed a Herrscher gem in her body.\r\n\r\nWith the Houkai's agitation of negative emotions, Sirin became extremely hostile to Schicksal, manipulated the Houkai energy, and caused the disappearance of researchers in Babylon Tower\r\n\r\nAfter discovered the mysterious disappearance of researchers, Schicksal sent S-Rank Valkyrja Theresa and the Snow Wolf team to investigate. At the same time, the Anti-Entropy leader also sent Tesla and Einstein to Siberia to investigate.\r\n\r\nAfter defeating the Valkyrja who saw her true identity, the darkness in Sirin's heart became more and more inflated. At the same time, the disappearance of Snow Wolf also speeded up the search of the Schicksal Organization. In order to gain more power, Sirin first manipulated the Houkai beasts and let them divert their attention for themselves.\r\n\r\nHowever, the hordes of Houkai beasts, on the contrary, only hold Schicksal and Anti-Entropy temporarily, then they all the way to the tower. Sirin consumed almost all of the Houkai energy to launch the space ability, and transferred to the location of the Imperial-level Houkai beast - Assaka that was being bred.\r\n\r\nHere, the Herrscher consciousness completely torn Sirin's original personality, completely occupying Sirin's body. At this point, the Second Herrscher: Sirin, the Herrscher of the Void, was completely born.\r\n\r\nNazoza is a small town in the North of Honkai Impact 3rd. Nazoza was once a thriving town before the destruction of The Honkai. It is now a ghost town, filled with nothing but dilapidated buildings and crumbling ruins. The only life remaining in the town is the Nazoza Resistance, a group of Valkyries dedicated to protecting the town and its people. Nazoza is a difficult town to reach, as the surrounding mountains are heavily guarded by the Honkai.

The CORAL Initiative was completed in 2006 and consisted of a main island and 3 super large scale platform isles. Buildings on vertically layered zones create a visage that resembled a natural coral reef and gave rise to the name of the artificial archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe 3 platforms have a triangular arrangement divided into different functional zones. An extensive and complex traffic network allows residents to conveniently access any platform. Residential zones with plenty of cultural and entertainment facilities are located at the base layers. The western platform serves as the financial district, while centers for science and R&D are located at the eastern platform.

Hundreds of theories about the organisation exist, but almost everyone dismisses them as fairy tales. This is what the organisation\u2019s leaders want. The World Serpent is the oldest organisation in the world to take up the fight against the Honkai and some of its members are the sources of many age-old legends. They will do whatever is needed to ensure Humanity victory over the Honkai, no matter the cost. Few in number they may be, but none can deny their unparalleled knowledge and technology; all that remains of the previous Era. Faction Bonus: The World Serpent possesses the highest quality support personnel and technology on the planet, allowing them many options in the field. If there is a technique or technology that is deemed impossible by current era technology, World Serpent would likely possess a functional sample of it.

Purge The Vile Honkai And Smash The False Gods.\r\n\r\nYour Sires Sleep In The Fields As Humanity's Brave Shields.\r\n\r\nBy The Judgement Of Shamash, Kaslana's Die And Never Yield\" (Full Oath)\r\n\r\nWhile watered down over centuries of history, this Oath has still remained. Its promise still compels the Kaslanas and urges them to protect humanity from the Honkai, even if their own life is at stake. While the original includes Shamash, the general idea is still kept in place.\r\n\r\nIt pushed Kallen Kaslana to abandon Schicksal and her family to hide away a dangerous black box. She went by the original Oath.\r\n\r\nIt pushed Siegfried Kaslana to activate his ICHOR and poison body in order to defeat the 2nd Herrscher once in war, and once when she took control of Kiana.\r\n\r\n\"Thou Shalt Constitute Thyself As A Shield For The Weak And Innocent\" is the variation Siegfried went by.\r\n\r\nThe Svart Opus is a military organization dedicated to the protection of humanity. Their origins are unknown, but they have been sighted all over the world. They are primarily interested in acquiring powerful weapons, such as the Honkai energy, and using those weapons for their own purposes. They are not opposed to using human shields or inflicting collateral damage to achieve their objectives. Their ultimate goal is to use Honkai energy to destroy Honkai and take over the world.\r\n\r\n\"Kiana, everything would have changed once you wake up. The world will no longer be a pretty place. Life as you know it will be replaced by something else. But\u2026 don't ever give up!\" - Major Murata, Himeko\r\n\r\nAmidst the ruins of a collapsing city, a single soul wonders aimlessly. The rain falls gently upon her snow-white hair as a powerful roar shakes the earth beneath her. She clenches her pistols tightly as hunger and exhaustion take their toll on her body. Soon she spots her prey and another. A young girl hiding from the beast trembles in the rain hoping in silence for a hero.\r\n\r\nValkyries are individuals who have awakened stigmata on their bodies, allowing them to harness and utilize honkai energy. The stigmata appear as almost a brand on the body taking a myriad of shapes and is typically awakened in very few family lineages. They can also be granted to an individual artificially through scientific experimentation, however often at the cost of shortening their lifespan considerably due to a lack of compatibility. Anyone can naturally awaken a stigmata, but it is exceedingly rare to awaken naturally or artificially within males. Such individuals are known as knights instead of valkyries.\r\n\r\nValkyries and Knights alike are typically trained at a young age for the position as they must undergo extensive mental and physical training for the road ahead. Their reflexes are second to none and some may even move so quickly time seemingly slows to a crawl. They tend to fight for any just cause but some may choose to instead walk the path of sin, embracing their innermost darkness. Clad in their battlesuits granting them a wide arsenal to face any foe they stride confidently into battle. When creating a valkyrie ask yourself how did they find themselves in this position? Did they survive a catastrophic event due to the hands of the honkai? Were they born into a prestigious family with a history within the field? Did they volunteer to become this super soldier-like entity? Or did they have nothing left but to give their body and soul for the people? Regardless of the circumstance valkyries serve as mankind's first and final bastions.\r\n\r\nSchicksal: \"To Protect Civilization From The Honkai\"\r\nWhen it comes to the forces that battle the Honkai, Schicksal is the name that springs immediately to mind. Schicksal is a world-spanning organisation, suspected to control far more of the planet than is publicly known, and the only group who publicly train and deploy Valkyries. These men and women - primarily women with the men known as Knights - utilise a previous era technology known as Stigmata and highly advanced battlesuits to face Honkai Beasts on even ground. Their only recognised rival on the world stage is Anti-Entropy, however many are unclear as to why the two groups often find themselves on opposing sides outside of Honkai disasters. But some do suspect, and for those who dig deeper and survive, some truths begin to take form. For all its shining symbolism, Schicksal may not be quite the pure force that it portrays itself to be. Faction Bonus: Schicksal Valkyries are trained from the beginning to work in teams and are never alone on the battlefield. Schicksal Valkyries can always call upon an ally when they need help in the field, barring exceptional circumstances. Schicksal Valkyrie battlesuits are optimised to support this synergistic method of combat, with squads of Valkyries being deployed to crisis points across the globe. Higher ranking Valkyries typically wield considerable personal power, and more esoteric abilities, but are also symbols both within and without the organisation.\r\n\r\nLiyue is a female class in Honkai Impact 3.

The faction is led by a mysterious figure known as the Black Sovereign.\r\n\r\nAnti-Entropy: \"Eradicate The Houkai without harming Humanity\"\r\nA new and rising group founded in America, Anti-Entropy is the youngest organisation to rise up to fight the Honkai. Unlike Schicksal, Anti-Entropy mainly deploys robotic and mecha forces against the Honkai and rarely deploy field agents to the field. They have a strained relationship with Schicksal and exist in a state of effective cold war with the organisation over many issues, the most prominent of them being the Schicksal usage of Valkyries as their front line soldiers. Anti-Entropy technology rivals Schicksal in many areas but remains inferior to them in a few key fields. Anti-Entropy possesses a near-peerless understanding of physics, as well as a mastery of engineering and mass production that none on Earth can match. When they choose to deploy, they do so with massed formations of drones and mecha, with at most a handful of operators operating them behind the scenes. Faction Bonus: Anti-Entropy combat forces come in all shapes and sizes, with each drone specialised to a specific purpose. Agents of Anti-Entropy can easily call upon different models should they require something they don't possess. These mechanised forces possess advanced autonomous and remote functionality, vastly increasing an agent\u2019s tactical options in the field. Valkyries wield specialised weapons against the Honkai Beasts and other foes the Honkai forms to face them. You are no different. Your main weapons is a:\r\n\r\nWhat is Honkai?\r\n\r\nThe common answer is that Honkai is a phenomenon as old as human history. It appears in a myriad of forms and has been responsible for many of the disasters in recorded history. Only a handful know that so many more disasters remain hidden by the lost knowledge of a previous era. And yet, despite the devastation the creations of Honkai have wrought, the Honkai itself is commonly seen as an almost natural phenomenon.\r\n\r\nYou shared in that belief until the day of your first encounter with the Honkai. Faced with creatures the manifestation of the Honkai itself, somehow you survived. But as with all who learn even a fraction of the truth, that encounter changed you. You learnt that Honkai is a living thing. For most, that thought is a terrifying one, something to flee from.\r\n\r\nFor you, it was a wakeup call.\r\n\r\nYou sought out Schicksal to become a Valkyrie, one of the symbols of hope and human strength that battle the Honkai. Humanity\u2019s great protectors, and as far as many are aware, civilisation\u2019s only line of defence against the Honkai. A truth that was swiftly shattered upon your passing of the rigorous entrance exams.\r\n\r\nIn your time as a Valkyrie, you\u2019ve learnt a great deal about the Honkai, and those who fight against them. You\u2019ve seen the valour of those who lay down their lives to protect humanity and the catastrophes that follow when they fail. And from those experiences, a picture has started to emerge. The Honkai isn\u2019t just a living thing. It has a will, and a desire to tear humanity down and render your entire species dust. Fighting the Honkai is like fighting a tsunami or a typhoon, but one with a brain.\r\n\r\nAnd at its head, where the winds rise to their highest, or the waves sweep away the land, are the Apostles of the Honkai. Humanity knows them as Herrschers, and so far, only one has risen to rain down destruction upon your civilisation. But no peace lasts forever.\r\n\r\nThe year is 2000 AD of the modern era, and long gone is the young woman who believed everything she was told by her superiors. In war as in life, there were choices you had to make between those who say they protect humanity. Now, somewhere deep in the arctic wastes, the tentative peace held since Berlin is about to be shattered.\r\n\r\nYou will stand against it, of course. But for whom will you stand?\r\n\r\nHonkai Impact 3rd is a third-person action-adventure video game. It was released by miHoYo for the Android and iOS platforms in October 2017.

The CORAL Initiative was completed in 2006 and consisted of a main island and 3 super large scale platform isles. Buildings on vertically layered zones create a visage that resembled a natural coral reef and gave rise to the name of the artificial archipelago.\n\nThe 3 platforms have a triangular arrangement divided into different functional zones. An extensive and complex traffic network allows residents to conveniently access any platform. Residential zones with plenty of cultural and entertainment facilities are located at the base layers. The western platform serves as the financial district, while centers for science and R&D are located at the eastern platform. Island administration also offers competitive policies that attracted numerous MNCs to establish offices at Coral, transforming the island state into yet another major economic hub in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe main island is home to the crown jewel and symbol of Coral. Given its advantageous location at the equator, it became the ideal place for a groundbreaking space elevator project.\n\nRapid development has propelled the young and vibrant island city of Coral into the center of the Asia-Pacific. Coral is the place of opportunities and wonders, and the growing space elevator serves will transform her into a shining beacon of the seas and a paradise for those who wish to build their dreams.",

            "content": "Schicksal: \"To Protect Civilization From The Honkai\"\nWhen it comes to the forces that battle the Honkai, Schicksal is the name that springs immediately to mind. Schicksal is a world-spanning organisation, suspected to control far more of the planet than is publicly known, and the only group who publicly train and deploy Valkyries. These men and women - primarily women with the men known as Knights - utilise a previous era technology known as Stigmata and highly advanced battlesuits to face Honkai Beasts on even ground. Their only recognised rival on the world stage is Anti-Entropy, however many are unclear as to why the two groups often find themselves on opposing sides outside of Honkai disasters. But some do suspect, and for those who dig deeper and survive, some truths begin to take form. For all its shining symbolism, Schicksal may not be quite the pure force that it portrays itself to be. Faction Bonus: Schicksal Valkyries are trained from the beginning to work in teams and are never alone on the battlefield. Schicksal Valkyries can always call upon an ally when they need help in the field, barring exceptional circumstances. Schicksal Valkyrie battlesuits are optimised to support this synergistic method of combat, with squads of Valkyries being deployed to crisis points across the globe. Higher ranking Valkyries typically wield considerable personal power, and more esoteric abilities, but are also symbols both within and without the organisation.\n\nSchicksal, a organization that was founded too stop Honkia from spreading and keeping peace in the world Schicksal Valkyries are some of the best Valkyries in the world. Valkyries can wield honkai energy to fight with. For some reason women are more compatible with honkai energy men can have honkai compatibility though it is rare.",

It appears in a myriad of forms and has been responsible for many of the disasters in recorded history. Only a handful know that so many more disasters remain hidden by the lost knowledge of a previous era. And yet, despite the devastation the creations of Honkai have wrought, the Honkai itself is commonly seen as an almost natural phenomenon.\n\n The Honkai isn\u2019t just a living thing. It has a will, and a desire to tear humanity down and render your entire species dust. Fighting the Honkai is like fighting a tsunami or a typhoon, but one with a brain.\n\nAnd at its head, where the winds rise to their highest, or the waves sweep away the land, are the Apostles of the Honkai. Humanity knows them as Herrschers, and so far, only one has risen to rain down destruction upon your civilisation. But no peace lasts forever.\n\nhonkai is energy, and also virus, who wanted destroy humanity, for that they use Herrschers\n\n\nThe Honkia is a phenomenon that occurs to destroy humanity after it gets too advanced, the Honkia is a type of energy thought to be a sentient being the energy can be formed as monsters and can cause humans to become like zombies.\n",

            "comment": "",
            "content": "Appearance\nOtto Apocalypse is a young-looking man with blond hair tied to the side. He keeps his blonde hair and green eyes in all of his Soulium bodies. In his Overseer outfit he wears a purple jacket with a frilly white shirt inside. He has white gloves, a pink necktie, a brown belt, gray pants, and brown boots. The emblem of House Apocalypse rests on his jacket collar.\n\nPersonality\nAs a child, Otto was na\u00efve, but intelligent. He was able to create a functional toy plane on his own, and unsealed the Void Archives without much difficulty.\n\nOtto is shown to be obsessed with Kallen. He only tried to find the cure for the Black Plague because he thought she would been disappointed in him if he didn't. Ironically, this also shows how brilliant he is. His obsession is also made clear when he created a video game based off of him and Kallen, with the story being them getting married. The \"villain\" of the story was the woman Kallen fell in love with.\n\nHis only goal is to revive Kallen no matter the cost.\n\nFor the sake of this goal, he has prevented the death of the 2nd Herrscher (whose eruption ended up killing millions worldwide) just so he could try and figure out a way to revive her. He has also: created a vessel for said Herrscher to reawaken into (which once again killed millions), tried to bomb New York, blackmailed his subordinates with their loved ones' safety, and so much more. He has done all this while knowing Kallen would hate him for it. His creepy nature is also shown in the fact he still has Kallen's dead body after all these years.\n\nHe is very sensitive to possible threats. This was shown in his sabotage of Schicksal's North American branch and his reaction to Siegfried Kaslana activating his ICHOR. In both instances Otto's actions costed innocent lives. In the latter, Otto made the order to fire missiles at Siegfried and the 2nd Herrscher even though Amber suggested sending in back-up. He did this in part to get rid of Siegfried and to take credit for the defeat of the 2nd Herrscher.\n\nHe is cruel, twisted, and treacherous: willing to kill millions for his own selfishness. He is the source of many of the problems present in other characters' lives.\n\nHistory\nOtto was born in 1452. He was the youngest child of the Apocalypse family, and was constantly locked up in the estate. At 13 years old, Otto made a toy plane overnight. He ran outside, excited to test his creation, but the wings were torn mid flight, and the plane went over the wall keeping him inside of the manor.\n\nOne of Otto\u2019s brothers came out to the yard and belittled him. He told him to stop inventing and take his medicine instead. As Otto desperately tried to get his plane back, he goaded Otto by saying he\u2019ll never get over that wall, and that he\u2019s embarrassed to have a younger brother that\u2019s \u201chardly strong enough to stay alive\u201d. He called him useless and twisted the knife by saying he\u2019s the shame of the family. Otto cried all the while.\n\nKallen Kaslana suddenly appeared over the top of the wall, saying that his invention was amazing. Otto stood there in awe as she praised him. Otto notes this is the first time anyone\u2019s ever said anything nice to him. Her optimism stuned his brother into silence, and she returned his plane. Kallen invited Otto on a \u201cquest\u201d to \u2018save the world and make it a better place\u2019. The two became close friends from then on.\n\nStill young, he and Kallen witnessed Sir Francis Kaslana, Kallen\u2019s father, fight off hordes of Honkai Beasts before being consumed by the Cleaver of Shamash. Seeing how upset Kallen was, Otto ran to a room which housed a golden box: an artifact that is said to only be unlocked by \u201cthe wisest\u201d. Otto unlocked it with ease. The box opened, revealing a small glowing orb known as the Void Archives. Otto asked it to bring Sir Francis back to life, and it agreed, asking for his life in exchange. Otto accepted without hesitation.\n\nAt the funeral, Otto ignored the priest\u2019s talk of the afterlife, and could only think of the Kaslana Oath. He feared that Kallen would eventually follow in her father's footsteps. He returned to the funeral with a glowing yellow spear (a replica of the 6th Divine Key created by Void Archives), and told Kallen that he can return Sir Francis back to life by giving up his own. Kallen smacked him and yelled at him, saying that Sir Francis died saving their lives, and it was wrong for him to throw it away for a lie some being told him. Otto apologized and hugged her as she cried.\n\nManga Story\nElan Palatinus\nIn 1470, when the Black Plague was spread throughout Europe, Otto worked tirelessly to find a cure, thinking that Kallen would leave him if he didn\u2019t. Eventually, he finds one. The first person he cures is named Eleanor, and she decides to become a Valkyrie to repay Otto. Eleanor was presumably an orphan, but Otto's step-mother allowed the girl to take up the Schariac name.\n\nLeading up to the confrontation with the Ming Army, a rift had begun to form between Otto and Kallen. Kallen didn't understand why they were going to war in the first place, and tried to ask Otto what he thinks. He deflected by offering her food, which he does every time she brings up the subject. During the Fight of Schicksal against The Ming Army (1475), Kallen was defeated by The Celestial. Otto is seen running to her aid, and stands in front of Kallen, intent on \u201cSaving Kallen, even if it costs [his] own life\u201d. However, The Celestial leaves them both alone. Otto carried the wounded Kallen off the battlefield and back to Schicksal\u2019s capital in Vienna.\n\nThe next we see of him is one year later, when he\u2019s walking down the streets with Kallen. After a short commotion, Kallen asks Otto if the indulgences Schicksal is forcing people to buy are just, but Otto takes her mind off of it with the offer of food. Later, when Kallen gets into a fight with a priest of Schicksal, Otto interrupts the two of them. His mere presence convinces the priest to back off. Otto convinces Kallen not to take vengeance on the priest. He then takes Kallen to see a show performed by Shakespeare, which is interrupted by Schicksal guards, who arrest Shakespeare for slander of the church. Otto witnesses Kallen save Shakespeare, knowing it\u2019s her despite the disguise Kallen put on. After the rescue, Otto notes this is the happiest Kallen has looked in a while.\n\nLater that night, Otto approaches Kallen, proposing to go steal from the evil priest and give it back to the people. Otto proposes to send a letter to warn them, because \u201cthat\u2019s what a rogue extraordinaire would do.\u201d The next night, Otto dresses up as a woman and pretends to sprain his ankle to distract the guards while Kallen sneaks in. The plan was a success.\n\nOtto is later shown sitting beside his father\u2019s throne, and prevents Victor from revealing the identity of the thief by changing the topic. Otto works on a stronger version of the Black Plague cure, as it has returned in a stronger strain.\n\nWhen Kallen breaks into the Basement of Victor\u2019s house and finds the crucified girls along with the black box, she is appalled. Otto was there, but he hid and listened to her shouting, questioning why Kallen came back. When Eleanor defeated Kallen, Otto grabbed the blade of the Black Abyss (Abyss Flower) and prevented Eleanor from dealing the final blow. Otto tells Eleanor\u2019s Valkyries to take Kallen away, but not to harm her.\n\nConsumed by the powers of the Black Abyss, Otto falls unconscious, and relives his memories of Sir Francis\u2019s death. However, this time it\u2019s Kallen in the coffin, not Sir Francis. Void Archives says he can prevent this fate with 2 boxes: a yellow box, and a black box (which was the one in the basement).\n\nWaking up in his bed, Otto rushes to see Kallen, and finds her in a cell being lectured by the Overseer on why the sacrifices of the girls were necessary. The Overseer entitles Otto to the job of \u201creturning her to the right path.\u201d After reinforcing what his father said, he yells at Kallen, calling her a fool for thinking she can solve anything by throwing her life at it. He brings up her father and is then promptly smacked. Otto agrees to save Sasha, but says that everything else is out of his control.\n\nOtto is there when the black box is opened, and he witnesses the battle between Eleanor and Kallen. When Kallen restrains Eleanor, she approaches Otto, saying that the box is evil and must be stopped. Otto responds by saying his father won\u2019t be swayed. When Eleanor again attacks, Otto accepts Void Archive\u2019s offer and accepts his power. He pulls out a Judgement of Shamash mimicry, exposing Eleanor\u2019s \"core\" and allowing Kallen to defeat her.\n\nAfter Kallen defeats the aspect of the Honkai inside her mind, Otto wakes her up. Kallen tells him it was the voice of the Honkai, and that she must take the box far away. Kallen then departs, leaving Otto kneeling in the throne room.\n\nPost-Elan Palatinus\nLater on, Otto uses Eleanor\u2019s remains to create a serum that gives people strength and allows them to wield the Abyss Flower. However, everyone he tested it on went insane and died. He then decides to open the Void Archives once more. The key tells Otto about its powers, and how it contains a massive amount of information from the Previous Era.\n\nHe then receives a letter from Kallen telling about what\u2019s happening to her in that moment, and he tells a group of loyal priests to deliver the Oath of Judah to her.\n\nMeanwhile, House Apocalypse was growing more and more unstable. Risa Apocalypse, Otto's big sister, was orchestrating events behind the scenes and preparing to take over Schicksal. At some point, Kallen allowed herself to be captured by Schicksal, and was sentenced to death. She felt hopeless due to the situation in Vienna and Yae Sakura's death. Otto tried to offer their possible marriage as a bargaining chip to save her life, but she refused to be under Schicksal's control.\n\nOtto became desperate. The day before Kallen was to be hung, he spoke with Risa (1477). They made a deal in which Otto was to \"get [his] hands dirty\" in exchange for the chance to take Kallen and run. The next day they set the plan in motion. Otto set free one of the Honkai Beasts kept within Schicksal's basement as a diversion for Kallen to escape, but it didn't go as planned. The beast went for a child, and Kallen was killed defending her.\n\nOtto could only watch as his plan to save his best friend killed her instead. He ran away by boat on his own and didn't come back for 14 years. During this time period, he established St. Michael's Abbey: an orphanage meant to teach the ways of 'The Holy Maid' (Kallen). These children would be his final gambit. They held Stigmata, which would help turn the tide when he came back in 1491 to overthrow Risa and Marseille. He and his army were successful, and he was crowned Overseer.\n\nOtto felt empty inside. This victory would've been what Kallen wanted -- but it was far too late. She was gone.\n\nThis unsatisfied feeling began his long journey to try and revive her.\n\n\nOtto Apocalypse is a stern business first type of man, he is the overseer of Schicksal, he constantly is trying to bring his loved wife back to life through any means necessary.",

She is the adoptive daughter of Siegfried Kaslana, alongside being a vessel for the 2nd Herrscher \u2014 Herrscher of the Void. After the events of Chapter 25, she awakens as the Herrscher of Flamescion. Ultimately after the events of Chapter 35, her will was approved by the Cocoon of Finality, granting her its power and allowing her to awaken as the one and only true Herrscher of the End.\n\n\nContents\n1\tAppearance\n1.1\tBattlesuit Appearances\n2\tPersonality\n3\tRelationships\n3.1\tRaiden Mei\n3.2\tMurata Himeko\n4\tHistory\n5\tManga Story\n5.1\tEscape from Nagazora\n5.2\tSt. Freya High\n5.3\tGratitude Arc\n5.3.1\tAnti-Entropy Invasion\n5.3.2\tMoon Shadow\n6\tGame Story\n7\tTrivia\nAppearance\nKiana has messy white hair that's often tied into two big braids. Normally, her eyes are a bright sea blue, which is in contrast to the quiet, yet deadly, golden eyes of the sleeping Herrscher within.\n\nBattlesuit Appearances\nWhite Comet: Kiana dons a white bodysuit with splashes of orange and black scattered along it. This suit also has three mechanisms on its back-- all of them glowing when the suit is activated. Two big stars dot the side of the suit legs as well.\nValkyrie Ranger: Kiana wears a white and yellow shirt on the top with a black body stocking as a Schicksal logo is drawn on it, black long gloves, a bullet belt on her hips, brown belts on her hips and thighs, gray shorts, black thigh highs and brown boots.\nVoid Drifter: Kiana has long white hair, a blue eye on the left and an orange one on the right and wears a black and orange hairpin, a black coat, a black and white suit, black and white gloves, a white belt, a black thigh boot on her right leg and and a black shoe on her left.\nDivine Prayer: Kiana wears a black cross-shaped hairpin, a black and white suit with a triangles-shaped cape, white long gloves, white thigh highs, and black and yellow shoes.\nKnight Moonbeam: Kiana wears a black cross-shaped hairpin, a white and black suit, black gloves, a blue belt, black shorts, black thigh highs and white boots.\nHerrscher of the Void: Kiana has long white hair and orange eyes and wears a black and orange hairpin, a yellow Kaslana collar, black fur on her shoulders, a black, white and pink suit, a long black and pink glove on her left hand and a black glove one on her right hand, a white and orange wing and 3 Subspace Lances on her back, black and pink shorts, black thigh highs and shoes.\nHerrscher of Flamescion: Kiana has long white hair tied in a ponytail, with two large streaks of red flowing through. Her eyes are blue and she wears red earrings, a black crown-like crown accessory in her hair, a flowing cape reminiscent of flames, and white knight-like armor accented with black and orange.\nHerrscher of Finality: Kiana has\nPersonality\nKiana Kaslana, or K423, was at first a very boastful, overconfident and \"idiotic\" girl who took a great liking to food. She was happy-go-lucky, and confident she could do anything she set her mind to. She often smiled, even if she was injured, and adored the company of her friends, whom she showed great affection to. Her happy-go-lucky attitude and her overconfidence often caused her to make reckless decisions without a second thought, especially if it was to save others, even if it meant sacrificing herself.\n\nHowever, after the 4th Honkai Eruption occurred by the hands of her \"other self\", Kiana's personality changed drastically. She matured into a person who was trying to find the resolve to counter the 2nd Herrscher haunting her, and, wallowing in her guilt and depression, she became a much more quiet, serious and thoughtful person. Although she found the resolve to keep going, she was still afraid of anyone getting hurt because of her, believing that, if anyone had to be hurt, it should be her. Around Mei, however, she faked her happy-go-lucky attitude frequently so Mei's concern wouldn't grow.\n\nAfter gaining the ability to tame some part of the Herrscher's power, while she stayed at Anti-Entropy's Salt Lake base, she kept to herself a lot. When people avoided her in the cafeteria out of fear, she decided to eat later rather than scare them. Despite continuing to be a very considerate person who puts others above herself, she seldom involved herself in conversations or attempted to participate in any friendships, showing a great contrast to her previous attitude, out of fear for hurting others.\n\nDuring the events that transpired within the Theatre of Domination, Kiana faced her \"dark side\", the Herrscher of the Void. After coming to terms with the fact that both of the personalities within her are a manifestation of Sirin, she is able to take full control of her body and powers by gaining the Herrscher's respect. Despite all the hardships she faced, and the horrors caused by her other persona, Kiana decided to move forward with her loved ones, carrying forward the legacy left to her by Himeko, and resolving to fight for the beauty of the world.\n\nFinally, during the events that transpire on the Moon, Kiana shows her growth throughout all the situations she's had to face. She now shows much more resolve to change the world and surpass the Honkai, while also finding a better way to do so than World Serpent's Project STIGMA, not wanting to effectively kill humankind. After becoming the Herrscher of Finality, Kiana regains some of her original traits, becoming once again more cheerful and somewhat childish, but with a much clearer maturity that allows her to use her powers responsibly and effectively. Being able to move on to a more peaceful life, despite her duties on the Moon, allows her to enjoy more time with her friends once again, though the fact that they cannot directly be together much of the time saddens her.\n\nRelationships\nRaiden Mei\nKiana and Mei have a special bond unlike anyone else's. Both of them were tossed aside by fate, and thrown into their own perspective chaos. But when they met, they were no longer alone in the world. Kiana has always been open about her romantic feelings for Mei. Mei usually scolded her for being too open about it on missions, but when Kiana fell under the Herrscher of the Void's control, Mei reflected on how much she cared for Kiana as well. Kiana thought of their reunion often after regaining control of her body. But when faced with the one she loved, whom she had nearly killed, she was terrified. She no longer wanted to be a burden in Mei's life, and felt that she had destroyed the happiness Mei finally found at St. Freya. Even as Mei begged her to come back to Hyperion, she refused.\n\nAfter saving Arc City and escaping from the Schicksal base in North Africa, the effects of the humongous amount of Honkai energy in her body began to fully take its toll. Mei found her on the brink of death in Nagazora, where they had first met. Kiana's condition was terrible, but she put on her best smile for Mei, as always. As the Honkai energy in Nagazora went out of control, and a wormhole opened in the sky, Kiana finally admitted to Mei she didn't care if she died before heading off on Benares.\n\nKiana was injured, and knocked off of the dragon by Husk-Nihilus. She was saved by Kevin Kaslana, as per the deal Mei made with him. At first, Kiana thought Kevin was blackmailing Mei to join the World Serpent. But Mei said it was of her own volition and that Kiana didn't need to worry about her anymore. Kiana refused to let her go, so they fought. It was in this fight that Mei herself was also honest, and said that the world meant nothing to her if Kiana wasn't in it. Kiana was unable to defeat the newly awakened Herrscher, and passed out.\n\nAs time had passed, Kiana begun to understand and accept why Mei left. She realized in trying to save Fu Hua how much her own self sacrificing attitude had hurt those around her. She decided in becoming the Herrscher of Flamescion that she wouldn't hide her true feelings anymore. As of now, she still thinks of Mei as her best partner.\n\n--\n\nMurata Himeko\nAs a child born with no mother, and with a father that left her, Kiana naturally gravitated towards Himeko. At first, she was prickly. She thought that as a Kaslana, she was invincible, but Himeko proved her wrong by defeating her in a duel. After this, Kiana began respecting Himeko more. One time, on Fathers Day, Himeko found Kiana moping about the campus. Even in her drunken state, Himeko could tell something was wrong, so she asked Kiana about it before being brushed off. Eventually, though, Kiana admitted she was thinking about her dad. Himeko gave her a speech about her own issues in the past before bringing Kiana into a hug. Kiana protested, but let her do so.\n\nIt's been shown various times that Himeko was a big pillar in Kiana's life. From changing her perspective on what it meant to be a Valkyrie, to her eventual final lesson, Himeko guided Kiana down her path. Kiana often called her 'Auntie', much to her chagrin. But when the Herrscher of the Void took control over Kiana's body, Himeko stepped up to save her.\n\nKiana was shattered by her sacrifice. All her childishness and spunkiness had been replaced with guilt and fear. She ran away to Arc City, not knowing what to do anymore. Eventually, she tried to commit suicide, but Fu Hua stopped her. It was in remembering what Himeko said in her last moments that Kiana was able to fight the Herrscher of the Void for control over their shared power. Kiana lived by Himeko's words, and her request that she keep living. In saving Arc City, she felt she had finally done part of her duty.\n\nBut her heroism was marred by the constant guilt raging in her mind. And it was only after saving Fu Hua she realized that.\n\nThe Herrscher of Domination confirmed what Kiana feared. Himeko had died saving her. It was in this scenario that Kiana finally got to see Himeko again, though. It was a fragment of her, but her nonetheless. When Kiana took the Gem of Haste, she entered a world of white. There, she and Himeko walked together, reminiscing about the past. Himeko lightly teased her about hiding in the same bushes all the time, and how she only liked the combat class. But they both knew this couldn't last forever. Kiana had to go defeat the Herrscher of Domination.\n\nKiana was going to say goodbye, but couldn't bring herself to do it. She cried and apologized to Himeko for what happened, and said she just couldn't find it in herself say goodbye. Himeko patted her head and told her how proud she was. She said Kiana truly was her best student. If the player chooses to continue talking to Himeko before leaving, Himeko reminisces on more memories with Kiana. After a while, she begun telling Kiana what Ragna's final letter said. She said she never comprehended what it meant until meeting her. And after a bit more talking, Himeko only stares fondly at Kiana, and says nothing more.\n\nIt was in defeating the Herrscher of Dominance that Kiana could finally let go of the guilt she bared. She is ready to keep living. She wants to give hope to others, just as Himeko did for her.\n\nHistory\nBorn on December 7th 1998, Kiana Kaslana was a carefree, bright and playful child. However, her family was torn apart as the Second Honkai War ravaged the land, and with her mother dead, and her father a fugitive, Kiana was taken by Otto Apocalypse to be examined. Otto kidnapped her to study the Kaslana genes and figure out how Siegfried got his powers. When he was unsuccessful, he instead started making clones of her, with the intention of using one of them as a vessel to bring back Sirin (the 2nd Herrscher). This was successful with clone K-423: in which the core was implanted during growth, with Kiana Kaslana's DNA infused within. The clone developed a consciousness and became sentient, unlike all the other attempts.\n\nPresumably living with Otto for quite some time, K-423 was eventually taken back by Siegfried in 2007. Siegfried tried to bring both Kianas (the original and the clone) with him, but lost the original in the confusion and rush. He managed to escaped and fled to a cabin in the woods, where he and K-423 lived for three years. During this time Siegfried was still grieving for his losses, and refused to acknowledge the clone as his daughter. He gave her what she needed to survive, and gifts on her birthday, but otherwise ignored her. K-423 was lonely, but she still cared for him very much, tending to Siegfried's wounds when he'd go out and fight the Honkai.\n\nOne day, Siegfried came home heavily injured from fighting Honkai, and collapsed inside the cabin. K-423 wanted to help him, so she grabbed the Shamash guns and went outside, where she found a Emperor class Honkai beast. Right before it stabbed her with its lance, Siegfried smashed its arm and kills it. Touched that K-423 wanted to fight the Honkai, he acknowledged her as a Kaslana and gives her the name of his daughter, Kiana. Kiana fondly remembers this moment, calling it the best birthday gift he had ever given her. The two make a pact to \u201cfight for all that\u2019s beautiful in the world\u201d. One year later (2010), Sirin woke again, forcing Siegfried to put her back to sleep, losing an arm in the process. Siegfried left Kiana for unknown reasons, leaving her to wander the planet looking for him. She traveled to many countries in her search, including Italy, Haiti, and the Philippines.\n\nThis eventually led her to Chiba academy in Nagazora (Honshu, Japan), where she met Raiden Mei. Kiana reached out to the girl, and despite Mei's reluctance, the two quickly became friends. Kiana eagerly hung out with her, eventually freaking out when she tried Mei's homemade cooking. She begged Mei to make food for her as well, since any time she tried to cook it would end in disaster. Mei agreed to her ridiculous list of food requests, and began making lunches for the both of them. Kiana also stood up for Mei when others would bully and mock her, despite the rumours that they spread about Kiana as well. She frequently repaid Mei in whatever way she could think of, even giving her the only umbrella she had in a downpour. When Mei asked Kiana why she reached out to her with all the rumours of her father, Kiana only said that \"Mei is Mei\", no matter what her father may or may not have done.\n\nThe two found solace in each other, and were no longer as lonely as before.\n\nKiana and Mei lived peacefully until the latter unexpectedly rose as the 3rd Herrscher: the Herrscher of Thunder. Her eruption sparked a huge amount of Honkai energy accumulating; turning everyone but Kiana into mindless zombies. Kiana fought against the personality that took over her friend, and eventually defeated her. When Mei awoke and tried to commit suicide, Kiana grabbed her hand and told her not to give up. After coaxing her to reconsider, Kiana was able to pull her up. The two of them traveled Nagazora for some time before running into Bronya Zaychik, who joined them in their journey to escape the city.\n\nThere is another version told where Mei and Kiana only meet after the former became the Herrscher of Thunder. In this version Kiana is as persistent as ever, not giving up until she can \"save\" Mei from the Honkai. This version's Herrscher personality is the one who decides to jump off of the rooftop, afraid of Kiana's kindness. In the end, she still takes Kiana's hand.\n\nManga Story\nEscape from Nagazora\nOne day, when the three were fighting against Honkai, they ran into an unusually big swarm of them. Bronya was thrown through a few buildings in the confusion, and Mei was too worried about her to notice an Emperor aiming for her. Kiana noticed, however, and pushed her out of the way, taking the blow for her. The two fell to the ground, Kiana bleeding out before Mei's eyes. The immense emotional stress caused Mei to erupt, which alerted Schicksal with the massive spike in Honkai energy. Schicksal sent their battleship Hyperion to investigate and put down whatever caused the spike. This team, led by Murata Himeko, arrived and tried to fight off the Herrscher personality. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for her to decimate a big portion of the ship. Kiana awoke during the fight, and broke Mei\u2019s Herrscher wings in an attempt to get the normal Mei back. She fell unconscious soon after.\n\nKiana wakes up in the St. Freya medical ward, where she meets Theresa Apocalypse. Theresa makes a deal with Kiana: if Kiana enrolls in the academy and becomes a Schicksal Valkyrie, she will tell her where Siegfried is. Kiana accepts only after knowing that Mei is safe.\n\nSt. Freya High\nKiana's overconfidence was challenged constantly at St. Freya. From the first day of training, to her first test, Kiana finds that even though she survived alone for so long, there were things she wasn't good at. Bronya decides to help her out with her remedial exams and sets up a virtual reality link so Kiana can learn history visually instead of using textbooks.\n\nThey go from the first recorded instance of animals infected by the Honkai (2717 BCE) to the 14th Century, and in that virtual reality, Kiana sees the Oath of Judah sitting out in the open. Curious about it, she places her hand on it. All of a sudden it recognizes her as a member of the Kaslana house, and pulls her into another virtual space. She falls from the sky and into the arms of Kallen Kaslana. The two can barely begin talking before a group of people in black robes appear.\n\nThey questioned her motives for leaving them, and Kallen simply said she wanted to save Kiana. While some of the guards didn't believe her, one in a more detailed mask stopped their complaints. The masked figure asked Kallen to make a confession so she wouldn't be executed, but Kallen refused.\n\nOne of the guards responded by tugging at her chains harshly, and Kiana kicked the assailant in retaliation. While boasting, she was attacked by another one of the masked figures and blacked out.\n\nKiana awoke in a prison cell with Kallen across from her. They introduced themselves and chatted for a bit: Kallen saying the masked person who took Kiana down was Lord Arthur, who formerly trained her. Kiana asked why she was in trouble, to which Kallen responded that she stole something. Kiana excitedly compared her to Robin Hood (aka stealing to give to the poor), but Kallen told her she had simply stolen an ancient artifact from those who wanted to use it for their selfish gain. Afterwards, she swiftly shut down discussion.\n\nKiana awoke the next morning to the message that her \"mother\" had been sent to pick her up. She was confused, but asked Kallen if she would be okay alone. Kallen reassured her before the prison guard shoved Kiana away from the cell. It turned out Bronya was pretending to be her mom, and had hacked her way into the data space Kiana had fallen into. Bronya stated it was a hidden sector of the memory archives only available to those of the House of Kaslana, and that she had some trouble getting in. She also mentioned it was advanced in the sense of having hyper-realistic and interactive feedback settings.\n\nWhen Kiana brought up Kallen, Bronya told her that that was her ancestor: Kallen Kaslana. They had learned about her in history class, but Kiana hadn't been paying attention. Basically, she was the top Schicksal valkyrie before stealing a black box containing a Honkai Core (specifically belonging to the Herrscher of Corruption). She ran away to the Far East, where she fell in love with Yae Sakura, who was eventually corrupted by the being in the box Kallen stole. She was forced to seal her away.\n\nShe was brought back to Europe for questioning and in trial declared that she was in love with Sakura, and that she was an innocent person. Kallen was sentenced to death by hanging. Kiana seethed at this new information, saying that those corrupted by Honkai were once human, and they aren't at fault for being misled by it. She said that loving a Herrscher isn't a sin.\n\nKiana declared they should save Kallen. Bronya said that was ridiculous since this was a VR world, and that Kallen Kaslana was long dead in the real one. This didn't perturb Kiana, however, and she insisted it was the right thing to do. Bronya gave in, and they started planning how they would save her.\n\nThe plan was to set off explosives as a distraction. Kiana would take advantage of the confusion to defeat the masked people and save Kallen.\n\nThe day of the execution, everything was going as planned up until Kiana swooped in. Suddenly, Lord Arthur pointed them towards the harbor, where he had arranged ships to take Kallen to somewhere safe. All seemed to be going great, until large and unusual Honkai Beasts swarmed the city. Otto arrived, explaining he had set them loose from the underground facilities Schicksal carried them in, and was doing it to save Kallen.\n\nKallen slapped him and pronounced she would defend the citizens instead of going with him. Kiana joined in her efforts, but they were fruitless. Kallen saw a beast going for a child and stepped in, taking a huge spike through her stomach in the girl's stead. Kiana tried to fight back, but without weapons it was useless.\n\nBronya rushed to get Kiana and herself out of the simulation, when she fell from her vantage point. The real Otto Apocalypse caught her. He was impressed with the two of them, and decided to let them have access to data for the Godsbane Battlesuit: Knight Moonbeam. The suit was deployed onto Kiana and she easily defeated all the beasts that attacked the town.\n\nAfterwards, Kiana comforted Kallen, saying that everyone was safe. Kallen thanked her, saying that as a VR character, it was unexpected to be treated so kindly. She went on to say she realized after a while that she was a VR character due to the repetitive script and being killed again and again in the same way. Kallen thought Kiana's appearance might change something, but that didn't seem to be the case.\n\nKiana told her the real Kallen had died more than 500 years ago and VR Kallen responded that Sakura must've been alone for that long, too. She asked Kiana to send a message from her to Sakura if they ever met. This message is not revealed to readers, but after hearing it, Kiana says her ancestors are just as dumb as her.\n\nGratitude Arc\nShe plays a minor role in the Gratitude arc, but nothing much of note happens with her there.\n\nAnti-Entropy Invasion\nWhile Himeko was in her coma from an accidental stigma spike on the Chiyou mission, Kiana was left distraught. Sitting outside, worried, Kiana experiences a hallucination to which she meets her father, who strangely shoots her with the Judgement of Shamash, calling her monster that must be silenced. She immediately comes to her senses after being called a monster, and rushes to eat dinner at the dorms. The trio eats dinner with Kiana eating with a heavy heart, until Theresa comes and shares the good news: Himeko is on a good path to recovery.\n\nThe next day, Kiana does a virtual simulation of training that scans Kiana's brain for potential enemies and creates images of them, with a new battlesuit that is only given to B rank Valkyries, White Comet (which interestingly becomes her staple battlesuit later on). She defeats all the images summoned, with the last one supposed to be Mei as the 3rd Herrscher, however the 2nd Herrscher inside of her unconsciously alters it to be Siegfried, hinting that the 2nd Herrscher is afraid of Siegfried.\n\nWhile fighting Siegfried, Theresa receives news that Mei has been attacked by a clone of the 1st Herrscher, with Mei disabling the bomb that should've blown her up if the Herrscher's will awakened. Upon hearing this, Kiana demands \"Siegfried\" to let her go, to which he refuses, saying that Mei is the 3rd Herrscher, stating that the Kaslana oath is to defeat the Honkai. Kiana suddenly remembers everything that occurred 4 years.\n\nWhen Kiana is caught off guard, Siegfried unites the two twin guns into its Zweihander form, which shocks Theresa as she realizes that Kiana has seen the Judgement of Shamash in its complete form before. In her distress, Kiana remembers the words her father told her: \"We're supposed to do whatever we can to protect those we love\", and stands up to Siegfried. Siegfried surrenders, and tells Kiana to go save Mei.\n\nKiana in fact, arrives just in time to save Mei and even fights the 1st Herrscher clone, with her almost dying due to White Comet running out of battery. Just as the clone was about to land his blow, Mei opens a global time fracture which gives the two enough time for Mei to recharge Kiana's white comet with her Honkai power, allowing Kiana to fuse it into Moonbeam Empress and shoot a lasting blow on the clone. The two are then, finally left in safety.\n\nMoon Shadow\nMoon Shadow occurs one month after AE invasion, with Anti-Entropy making yet another Welt Joyce clone that assisted Dr. Magi in retrieving the Gem of Serenity from Schicksal. The two stay at Singapore to hide, and so Otto sends Fu Hua to take back the Gem of Serenity, alongside asking to bring Kiana along so that Otto can see how much his replica has progressed. Fu Hua disguises this as a mission to allow Kiana to get bonus points for her lowly grades.\n\nWhile Fu Hua was dealing with the 2nd Welt Joyce clone, Kiana was tricked and injected with a Honkai-neutralizing serum by Dr. Magi. When Kiana recovers, Dr. Magi tells Kiana to take more of the serum, telling her to live the life she deserves as a normal little girl. Kiana is outraged at the prospect of becoming a \"normie\" and not being able to defend humanity, and while Dr. Magi argues back, the 2nd Welt Joyce clone barges in and slits Dr. Magi's leg. In the staircase, Kiana tells him that she can't give up because her family has been fighting the Honkai for ages. Touched, Dr. Magi decides to bring Kiana to the Gem of Serenity.\n\nRealizing that Cocolia wants to create the Herrscher of Death, Dr. Magi warns Kiana to not take the Gem, however Kiana completely ignores this, believing that if she takes the core the Honkai Eruption won't occur at all. Kiana doesn't realize through doing this, she is temporarily waking the 2nd Herrscher once again.\n\nFu Hua meets Sirin in Kiana's body on the rooftop, where Sirin summons Knight Moonbeam powered with the Gem of Serenity. Fu Hua requests Otto to deploy Shadow Knight, which allowed Fu Hua to easily overpower Sirin, take back the Gem of Serenity, and save Kiana.\n\nGame Story\nHonkai Impact 3rd begins with the Honkai Eruption in Soukai city in 2016, where Himeko's 5th Squad is sent to dismantle all the Honkai beasts. After Kiana dealt with her bunch of Honkai Beasts, she lands on the Selene and meets Mei, where the both of them are caught by surprise by the Honkai beasts. The two are quickly overpowered from the Honkai beasts, and Mei, desperate, uses the power of the 3rd Herrscher to defeat all the beasts. When Bronya finds Mei and Kiana, Mei quickly falls unconscious.\n\nThe three venture into the battleship and Bronya notes that this battleship belongs to Anti-Entropy. The three also use Anti-Entropy technologies to venture in. When they arrive to the control panel, a letter addressed to Kiana is found in the master controller unit. It returns the battleship the Kiana and tells her that in order to \"ascend the throne and rule this world\", she needs to find 4 keys. It also says that the password to the bridge is Kiana's birthday, which Bronya enters. This then reroutes the battleship to St. Freya High. Just as Mei and Kiana relaxed, the biochip in Bronya's brain suddenly reacted and was set to purge all surrounding hostiles, attacking Mei and Kiana.\n\nMei and Kiana thankfully defeat Bronya, letting Bronya regain consciousness and report back to Himeko. Bronya requests a physiological exam which reveals the energy from the Selene may have interfered with Bronya's biochip. Back in peace, the Valkyries resume their training for the next Valkyrie Exam, where Himeko tells Kiana that she will have training with Fu Hua to practice for the Exam. That night, Kiana has a dream where she hears a whisper welcoming her home. This ghost taunts her with information of her family.\n\nThe next day, the trio do more training with data simulations and Fu Hua, and Kiana meets Himeko, where Himeko says she doesn't believe Bronya was affected from the Selene but rather something else. This night, Kiana experiences another dream, where the ghost poses as her loved ones and insult Kiana and Mei, angering Kiana. The ghost continues to taunt Kiana, telling her they will meet again.\n\nOn the day of the exam, Rita Rossweisse, the second S-rank Valkyrie appears, interested in the Kaslana present at the exam. As the trio travels through the exam, the final stage of the exam breaks and instead summons Ganesha, an Emperor class Honkai beast, too powerful for a B-rank Valkyrie to face. Nonetheless, the trio successfully defeats it, impressing Rita.\n\nWith the exam over, Kiana and her party were on the way back to the dorms, when Kiana suddenly collapsed and meets the whispering ghost again, when Kiana realizes that the ghost is the 2nd Herrscher, and although Kiana manages to beat down the ghost, the ghost taunts her, telling Kiana that it will return and that it will never stop haunting her. Rita remarks that the impact made by the Selene was quite severe, but in truth, Rita knew the truth of why Kiana was having the dreams.\n\nAfterwards, the newly ranked Valkyries are told they need to find the Gem of Desire in New Zealand. Meeting Wendy, a Valkyrie with the Gem of Desire implanted in her legs, making her unable to move. The trio quickly became good friends with Wendy, however the Gem of Desire starting to feed of off Wendy's hatred, giving birth to the 4th Herrscher of Wind. Although the girls successfully recovered Wendy to her senses, Cocolia unfortunately invaded Bronya's biochip and set her to attack the 4th Herrscher, which also reveals that Bronya's sudden action of attacking Mei and Kiana were not from Selene's influence but from Cocolia's. Not only this, both Mei and Wendy are taken by Anti-Entropy with Bronya following Cocolia's orders against her will.\n\nKiana, Himeko and Theresa all go to ME corps to save the other three girls, and luckily manage to save Mei but yet unfortunately at the price of Bronya blowing up her biochip, leaving her in critical condition. Not only this, Cocolia informs the party that Wendy has already been killed and the Gem of Desire is in AE's hands. Cocolia leaves them to fight Wotan, a powerful AE technology. The girls manage to return back to St. Freya, with Bronya in a deep coma that even St. Freya's doctoring could not wake up. Theresa then goes to St. Freya's underground church, where Schicksal's most powerful datas and technologies are stored. With the result strangely being the data reconstruct of the 2nd Honkai Eruption 16 years ago, Babylon Tower, Siberia. Theresa enters the dataspace, without knowing that Kiana was secretly following Theresa. In Kiana's curiosity, she follows suite into dataspace.\n\nKiana experiences the events on February 7th, 2000, the day Sirin woke as the 2nd Herrscher. She meets Theresa, who doesn't recognize Kiana as this Theresa is a simulation of Theresa from 2000. Not only this, she also meets Siegfried, her father and Cecilia Schariac, her mother. Kiana grows an attachment for Cecilia, even calling her Mom. This is interesting, for the reason K423 woke at all was because Sirin desired to be Cecilia's daughter, and to hear Cecilia tell her \"Ich Liebe Dich\". As Kiana and Cecilia venture into Babylon Tower to defeat the 2nd Herrscher, and it soon becomes apparent that Kiana is unable to differentiate that this is a data simulation, and that none of it is real due to Kiana's attachment with Cecilia. As both Cecilia and Kiana defeat the 2nd Herrscher, the two hug until Theresa appears and is about to take Kiana away, until Fu Hua appears.\n\nFu Hua brings Theresa away and tells Kiana the truth: everything she just experienced was not a virtual simulation, nor were they real at all; she has been standing in one place the whole time, and she has been living an illusion, a dream set up by the 2nd Herrscher within Kiana using Kiana's curiosity to her parents as her weakness. This news shocks Kiana upon realizing everything she experienced with her mother wasn't real, and collapsed into tears, telling Fu Hua to give her mother back. In this rage and confusion, Kiana remembers the magical words \"Ich Liebe Dich\" and constantly repeats it, allowing Kiana to use a portion of the Herrscher's powers and fight Fu Hua. Unfortunately, Kiana loses and Fu Hua brings her to Schicksal HQ. Theresa immediately orders to attack Schicksal HQ, along with allying with Anti-Entropy.\n\nKiana is then infused with an unimaginable amount of Honkai energy and the Gem of Serenity, which wakes the 2nd Herrscher who orders Benares to wake from the frost and snow of Siberia. Although Benares does delay Schicksal just a little bit, Schicksal still successfully gave time to the 2nd Herrscher to attain dominance over Kiana's body. Disabling all of Schicksal's defences and finding Mei who fell off of Hyperion, Mei uses the power of the 3rd Herrscher to attempt and save Kiana from the 2nd Herrscher, however the 2nd Herrscher defeats Mei as the 2nd Herrscher is, much more powerful than the other Herrschers. Mei fails to defeat the 2nd Herrscher, and the Sirin unleashes her Honkai beasts and destroys Anti-Entropy's mechs with one snap of a finger.\n\nMei notes that the 2nd Herrscher radiated immense Honkai power, and is even more interesting as while other Herrschers would take time to transform into their Ascended form, the 2nd Herrscher immediately woke in her Ascended form. The Herrscher, unimpressed by Theresa, Bronya and Mei's forces, brings them into her void space to kill them one by one, proving all of their attacks futile with even the Oath of Judah unable to bind the Herrscher. Fu Hua comes to attack the Herrscher to give the girls and Theresa time to escape, however the 2nd Herrscher leaves Fu Hua injured, and chooses not to kill her, with Otto letting her leave, much to Fu Hua's dismay.\n\nFor four months the world suffered in despair, fear and pain as the 2nd Herrscher unleashed billions of Honkai beasts and destroyed cities and countries, with the survivors fleeing to whatever sanctuaries there were.\n\nThe Herrscher meets Himeko with the Gem of Haste in Vermillion Knight on Hyperion, and the two fight. The Herrscher is enraged to see her own gem being used against her, and starts to monstrously attempt with nothing to stop her to kill Himeko. Just as she was about to kill Himeko, AE used the Selene on the Herrscher, which reduced her vast Honkai reserves to nothing but a flurry of heat. Before any of them could land a lasting blow on the Herrscher, the 2nd Herrscher escapes.\n\nHimeko, who easily defeats Benares after the 2nd Herrscher sends the dragon to attack Hyperion, is brought into the void space where the Herrscher welcomes her to die. Although the Herrscher managed to severely injure Himeko, slicing her and even throwing the void at her, even the Herrscher could not compete Himeko's determination and care for her student. In the end, the Herrscher defeats Himeko, only to realize Himeko has injected a Honkai neutralizing serum in her back. Screeching an ear splitting scream of pain and agony, the 2nd Herrscher's void space collapses and the 2nd Herrscher is put into a temporary slumber once more, however the Honkai eruption did not cease to spread.\n\nKiana washes over a shore where she wakes and sees the results of the 2nd Herrscher's awakening: a despairing world in the state of panic and suffering, and is now wanted with Rita Rosseweise being sent to capture her in Shicksal's name. As she traverses through Arc City, a metropolis sanctuary for the remaining refugees and survivors, she discovers the existence of World Serpent, an organization that has released Honkai in certain areas of the City.\n\nDuring her time in Arc City, she is constantly tormented with distress of being the catalyst of the world and even worse, the 2nd Herrscher wakes using Kiana's guilt over Himeko's death, and continues to gnaw at her weaknesses to regain control over her vessel again. While fighting a Honkai Beast, Kiana almost dies, where she is brought to an illusion constructed by the 2nd Herrscher, who reveals the terrifying truth while coaxing Kiana to join the 2nd Herrscher: everything about \"Kiana Kaslana\", a lie. Kiana Kaslana- no, K423, was only meant as a vessel for the 2nd Herrscher, made by a greedy human.\n\nIn her mental agony of realizing the truth, an illusion of Fu Hua appears thanks to the Feather of Fenghuang Down, which Kiana has been ignoring for three months, believing Fu Hua to be a spy and a traitor. Fu Hua and Kiana have a small exchange, where Fu Hua warns Kiana not to fight the Honkai, and Kiana, both stressed and angered, yells at Fu Hua, shunning her away and telling her to leave. Before Fu Hua leaves, Fu Hua asks Kiana to forgive her.\n\nKiana continues to fight the Honkai beasts, and laments over events in her life, remembering those she called her family and ended up hurting. Realizing she can't escape this fate and, weighed so heavily by guilt and meaninglessness to live, Kiana points the gun to her chin and just as she is about to pull the trigger, Fu Hua arrives, telling her now is not that time for despair, convincing her to live on.\n\nWhile fighting more Honkai Beasts, Kiana finds herself helpless and covers her head as the Sanctuary level Honkai Beasts head for her direction. Just as they do, a time fracture suddenly occurs, where Kiana meets an image of Himeko who walks past her and asks what she is waiting for. Gaining resolve to \"change this imperfect world into the one I want\", she masters a portion of the 2nd Herrscher's Void abilities, which contributes to Kiana's augmented core Void Drifter, where she is seen with one eye gold and one eye blue. Kiana accepts Fu Hua's help, and the two venture into Arc City.\n\nWhen playing as Kiana in Chapter 11 EX, there is an alternative ending if you let the Herrscher Charge fill where the Herrscher of the Void successfully gains control over Kiana's body and says \"the end of the Current Era is nigh\", implying that the Herrscher of the Void will proceed to destroy the rest of the world. However this is not the true ending and works more as a losing screen as you are allowed to play the stage again until you win.\n\nAfter Fu Hua saves Kiana, Fu Hua begins teaching Kiana how to defend herself against the Herrscher of the Void and grow stronger through using the 8th Key and creating a dream space. Here she learns how to use the Edge of Taixuan.",

Even before her father was arrested, she was used to silently accepting her loneliness within the home. When she went from being the center of attention at school to a \"criminal\", though, she grew more jaded. She still had a soft heart, but often put her guard up when people approached. This applied even to Kiana Kaslana.\n\nIt was only after Kiana innocently bombarded her with requests for food (despite her lack of skill at the time) that she began to soften again. This would be the start of her love for cooking.\n\nWhen Mei became the 3rd Herrscher, Mei's Herrscher personality woke. Mei's Herrscher personality was originally very malicious and cold: viewing those lower than her as scum. Her Herrscher personality could not only feel her pain, but also her joy (along with her feelings for Kiana). The Herrscher personality was touched when Kiana caught Mei from the edge of the school rooftop. However, both Mei and the Herrscher personality grew fearful of hurting Kiana and losing this precious bond. The Herrscher personality concealed herself within Mei to study Kiana in secret.\n\nAt St. Freya, Mei often took the role of a caretaker-- for both Kiana and the rest of the group. She would often cook for their little family, including packing lunches for her friends. She was always a good student, which carried over to her time in St. Freya. She scored in the top 3 for the first written tests they had to take.\n\nMei's Herrscher personality becomes kinder as time passes. She is willing to help Mei protect Kiana: fighting alongside Mei as Kiana's consciousness was overtaken by the 2nd Herrscher.\n\nEventually, Mei grows tired of her powerlessness. She no longer wanted to watch Kiana getting hurt without doing anything. Mei chooses to act on her feelings for once. She ascends as the Herrscher of Thunder, and leaves for World Serpent. Mei's personality then changes slightly. Despite being more cold and merciless than before, she is still kind. The only difference is that she has a new drive: the desire to protect Kiana. Even she admits that the fate that Ana Schariac and Owl suffered was not deserved, as she saw herself in Owl. She tries to keep a tough fa\u00e7ade, but the concern she showed towards the two proves there's some empathy she can't help but show.\n\nWhen fighting the Herrscher of Domination she shows a more sadistic and taunting side, using the Herrscher's fear of her to her advantage-- purposely putting herself in the middle of their plans and significantly weakening them with her superior ability.\n\nRelationships\nKiana Kaslana\nKiana was Mei\u2019s first real friend and helped pull her out of the darkness that loneliness brought her. When Mei awoke as a Herrscher, Kiana refused to abandon Mei or allow her to kill herself. Kiana promised Mei that she would protect her from the Herrscher within. Mei truly cares for Kiana, and takes extra care in watching over her. She is always worrying about Kiana, and often stays with her to make sure she doesn't get into trouble.\n\nKiana often declares her love for Mei in public, much to Mei's embarrassment. She reciprocates if it isn't an inappropriate time for it. When Kiana was captured by Schicksal, Mei could only think about how much she really cared for her. She specifically asked Theresa to disable the bomb next to her heart, despite the great fear she held for her power.\n\nMei tried her best, but was ultimately unable to do anything against the Herrscher of the Void. The Herrscher added insult to injury by taking the Gem of Conquest away from her. In the wake of the incident, the disappearance of both Kiana and Himeko left a huge impact on Mei. She began to see herself as weak, and unable to protect her loved ones. Mei chased any sign of Kiana, but when they finally met in Arc City, Kiana refused to return, fearing that she would harm her friends. Mei was shocked, and suddenly felt like Kiana was a stranger to her now. She could only watch as Kiana risked her life yet again to save the city, and was intercepted when trying to catch her. Durandal beat her to it.\n\nMei fought with all her might, but failed to even scratch the S-Rank Valkyrie. She attempted to pursue her afterwards, but could only fall to the ground in exhaustion. She wept at her helplessness alone in the middle of the street. After days of searching, Mei found Kiana at the brink of death in Nagazora. Mei was unable to sleep due to her anxiety. Nevertheless, she put on a smile for Kiana, and didn't say anything when she realized Kiana had been lying to her about her wellbeing. After overhearing Kiana tell the doctors to kill her if they have to, she decided to accept Kevin's offer to join World Serpent.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was when Kiana blatantly said she didn't care if she died. Mei chased after her again, but ultimately realized that she needed to fight. She embraced her Herrscher powers and emerged with a firm heart. Kiana refused to let her go with Kevin, and so they fought. It was in this fight that Mei was finally honest, and said that the world meant nothing to her if Kiana wasn't in it. Kiana was unable to defeat the newly awakened Herrscher, and fell unconscious. Mei gently sat her against the rubble and left.\n\n--\n\nBronya Zaychik\nMei and Kiana ran into Bronya in Nagazora. Mei immediately took her under her wing as a little sister of sorts. She treated Bronya like a human, not a weapon. Bronya had actually been deployed to capture Mei after her awakening, but decided to join Kiana and Mei on their journey. While at first it was only to monitor the two, Mei's care opened Bronya's heart up. Over time, Bronya genuinely came to enjoy her company, and they peacefully lived their days at St. Freya.\n\nIn the incident with the 4th Herrscher, Bronya was forced to capture Mei and Wendy. When the time came to face Kiana and the others, she asked them to take Mei and leave. Bronya burnt the biochip in her brain to give them the opportunity to escape. It impacted her enough to put her in a coma. Mei was devastated, and constantly fretted over her in the hospital. Despite learning the truth about Bronya, Mei still cared for her dearly.\n\nAfter the incident with the Herrscher of the Void, Mei and Bronya were separated, with Mei going to look for Kiana and Bronya heading for the underwater Anti-Entropy base. The two haven't interacted since.\n\n--\n\nDurandal\nMei first meets Durandal in Arc City. When she desperately attempted to take back the unconscious Kiana, she was confronted with the S-Rank Valkyrie and lost. Durandal states that Mei's ability lacks in comparison to her will. Durandal then takes Kiana away. This moment begins a series of events that would place Mei on a path leading towards World Serpent. When the two meet again on Coral Island, they agree to work together against a common enemy. When the Herrscher breaks loose, Mei and Durandal work together to subdue it. The two are shown to have a mutual respect for the other's ability.\n\n--\n\nRaven\nThe two meet as enemies, with Raven attempting to kill Kiana multiple times. In Nagazora, the two begin an uneasy truce to deal with Benares and get the orphans out of the ruins. When the truce ends the two battle. Raven at first believed that Mei is a weakling due to her losing her Herrscher powers, however Mei manages to muster strength from the residual power still within her. This turns the fight in her favor and Raven backs off to allow Mei to retrieve Kiana. Raven tells World Serpent that Mei could be a viable member.\n\nAfter Mei becomes a member, she suddenly treats Raven with as much coldness as anyone else. Even so, she is shown to worry about Raven when she is wounded by Owl. Raven is shown to trust Mei enough to go along with her secret plan. When the two are seen again in the Herrscher of Domination arc, they are much closer, with them stopping in at Raven's bar for a drink before visiting the orphanage together. They also share personal stories during a car ride and a walk on the beach. Their trust in battle is also shown when they are both dragged into the Theater of Domination.\n\n--\n\nElysia\nAfter Mei is recruited by Kevin to join World Serpent, Kevin sends her to the Elysian Realm, telling her that the Realm contains information regarding the nature of the Honkai. Upon entering the Realm, Mei is greeted by a simulation of Elysia, who introduces herself to Mei as the 2nd of the Previous Era's Thirteen Flame-Chasers, and that the Elysian Realm is a digital space hosting the simulated memories of those thirteen.\n\nMei is initially very wary of Elysia. This is due to her unusually cheerful and seemingly pure demeanour. This wariness is exacerbated as Mei meets more of the Flame-Chasers, who each have their own opinions about Elysia. One of which is Mobius, who openly labels Elysia as a \u201cTraitor\u201d.\n\nHowever, as Mei ventures deeper into the Realm, she comes to realise that the pure cheerfulness Elysia exudes is her nature. She begins to open up more to Elysia. At the end of the Elysian Realm's 3rd chapter, Elysia reveals to Mei that she is in fact the 13th Herrscher of the Previous Era. Despite that, the two remain strongly bonded. This is seen as Mei is actively involved in the search for Elysia after the latter is seemingly killed in Chapter 29 of the main story.\n\nThe two meet again for the last time in Chapter 31 after Eden reveals to Mei that Elysia was never the 13th Herrscher. Through Eden, Mei finds out that Elysia was born a Herrscher, and was actually the very first Herrscher to have existed. Mei finally meets Elysia in her Herrscher form and understands that Elysia\u2019s sacrifice in the Previous Era yielded in her existence as a Herrscher who fought for humanity. The two bid farewell as Mei returns to the real world.\n\nHistory\nOn April 13th, 1997, Raiden Ryoma and his wife gave birth to Mei in Nagazora City (Honshu, Japan). A few years later, her mother died of cancer. The year she died is not specified. Later, her stigmata awoke, and Ryoma sealed it as best he could. Some terrorist organization kidnapped her in 2004, and it isn't clear how Ryoma got her back.\n\nMei underwent 3 years of therapy afterwards.\n\nOtherwise, Mei lived a cushy life. Servants would prepare her lunches, everyone showered her in attention, and even with her father often gone for business, she had kendo lessons with Mr. HOMU (who was actually her father) to keep her busy. Life was beautiful. Then, all of a sudden, everything changed. Her father was falsely accused of embezzling funds by Cocolia, and was put in prison in 2013. Ryoma had told her a strong heart is what will get you through battle. She thought her heart was the strongest, but when everything collapsed before her very eyes, she knew she was wrong. The ME Corp assets were frozen, and she no longer had servants to help her get by. This is when Cocolia took over the corporation herself.\n\nAt first, Mei's cooking was awful, as she had never cooked a meal in her life. This time, when she asked her classmates to sit with her, they rejected her. No one wanted to hang out with a \"criminal's daughter\" after all. She realized that because she was no longer an heiress, no one cared about her. All their enthusiasm was for their own benefit. Mei found the Mr. HOMU costume in the training room, and realized her father had been training her all along. Alone, she could not handle the hatred threatening to engulf her. Then, Kiana Kaslana came into her life. Despite Mei being cautious towards this underclassman, Kiana managed to worm her way into her heart. She defended Mei from bullies, ate lunch with her, and gave her more than she had ever experienced before. Mei finally found a real friend. Kiana's enthusiasm for Mei's homemade lunch started a long love for cooking. Mei realized cooking was no longer simply to survive. Kiana told her it didn't matter what her father may or may not have done. She was Mei, and only Mei. The two found solace in each other.\n\nThey lived peacefully until the Gem of Conquest was stimulated in Nagazora in 2014. This gem awoke the hidden powers in Mei's stigmata long sealed away. The burst of Honkai energy that arose from her eruption turned almost every citizen into zombies. Kiana was not affected by the Honkai poisoning that plagued everyone else. At that point, another personality took control over Mei: one that hated humanity, and that was much more violent than the mellow friend Kiana had made. Even so, Kiana did not waver, and beat the personality back, allowing Mei to come to her senses. When Mei awoke, she looked on in horror at what she had done, and tried to jump off of the very roof the battle took place. Kiana reached out her hand and told her not to give up. Even after Mei exhausted all of the worries she had, Kiana still urged her to take her hand. Mei took it, and thus her fate was changed.\n\nThere is another version of her awakening that Mihoyo has told. Everything is the same except Mei chooses to ascend as the 3rd Herrscher in an act of revenge against all those who harmed her. In this version, Kiana meets Mei as the Herrscher personality. Even though this personality has many chances to kill Kiana, she doesn't. Kiana is still as stubborn as before, and keeps insisting she will save Mei from herself. Eventually, the Herrscher personality grows scared of her kindness and decides to end her life. Kiana reaches out for the Herrscher, and she accepts her defeat. Mei awakens, and begs Kiana to let go, but Kiana refuses. Just like the other version, Mei ends up taking her hand.\n\nThe two headed off to explore the city and find a way to survive. During this time, Mei still had doubts welling up within her, and told Kiana to leave her behind. Kiana refused, and promised Mei if she ever lost herself to that personality again, she would beat her as many times as it takes. Mei called her an idiot, but she was comforted by those words. Soon they met Bronya Zaychik, and the three kept wandering until a few months later.\n\nManga Story\nSecond Eruption\nMei briefly appears as a baby crying in her mother's arms as she watches a news report on a television screen in a city.\n\nEscape from Nagazora\nIn the midst of a Honkai attack, Kiana took a fatal blow for Mei, which caused her other personality to take control. The Herrscher personality made it clear that she wanted to kill Kiana herself, so she wouldn't let her die here. Schicksal, having already noticed the spike in Honkai energy, sent the battleship Hyperion to check out the situation. Among the crew was Murata Himeko. The two fought each other for only a little bit of time before Mei managed to heavily damage the battleship. Right when she was on the cusp of winning, the Kaslana in her arms woke up. To everyone's surprise, she shattered the wings of the Herrscher, thus putting that personality to rest once more.\n\nThe three girls were taken onto the Hyperion, and were offered the chance to be Schicksal Valkyries. At first, Mei opposed the idea, as she thought the Herrscher power inside her was too dangerous: if she were to be taken over again, the results would be catastrophic. She asked Himeko to simply kill her and get rid of the problem, but Himeko refused. She told Mei that if she's willing to give up her life, she should give it to saving people. Schicksal planted a bomb next to Mei's heart: one that would explode if her Herrscher powers were used for more than 5 minutes. This made Mei feel safer about attending.\n\nAE Invasion\nCocolia from Anti-Entropy wanted Mei's power, so she sent one of her clones of Welt Joyce to kidnap her. Neither Bronya nor Fu Hua could stop him, but Kiana swooped in just in time. Mei's Herrscher persona lent Kiana her power, and thus made the Moonlight Empress battlesuit, an alternate version of the Knight Moonbeam battlesuit. The two of them defeated the clone, and he ran off.\n\nIn this part of the story we learn that Mei's Herrscher personality actually cares about Kiana, and is afraid of hurting her. However, the Herrscher would never admit it out loud, and keeps up a mask of aggression.\n\nGame Story\nThe girls were on a mission to investigate and find the control room of a battleship named Selene that was flying over a big city. Shortly after Kiana and Mei met up on the aircraft, a Honkai beast Kiana thought she had defeated came back to fight. Kiana was injured, and Mei held off the beast with her sword. Desperate to save Kiana and herself, she let her other personality take over.\n\nThe stress on her body was too much, and she collapsed soon after.\n\nMei, Kiana, and Bronya headed to the first destination on their list: New Zealand, where the Gem of Desire was located. As it turns out, they met a girl named Wendy, who had the gem implanted in one of her legs in a similar fashion to Mei's own implant. The only difference is that the Honkai energy left her unable to walk, and that caused her to hate Schicksal, thus leading to her awakening as the Herrscher of Wind. The girls tried their best to fight her off, but during the battle, Anti Entropy titans (sent by Cocolia) came and subdued both Mei and Wendy. They took off with the two girls, Bronya assisting them (not by her own will).\n\nMei was kept hostage in the ME Corp, and is saved by Bronya, who destroyed the bio chip in her brain to stop following Cocolia's orders. When she wakes up, she was shocked to find Bronya in critical condition, and fights off the MSR-7 Wotan with Kiana, Theresa Apocalypse, and Murata Himeko.\n\nMei mostly stayed by Bronya's side, watching over her recovery. She rested for a while, but was awoken to the news of Kiana's capture. Once Kiana was confirmed to be captured by Schicksal, she and the Hyperion crew defected from the organization. The bomb was disabled per her request. She was exhausted, but remarked that she could only think of Kiana as she fought her way through the Schicksal defenses. Mei tried to fight the Herrscher of the Void (HoV), but to no avail. HoV ripped the Conquest gem from her body and nearly killed her in the process.\n\nNext, the crew of Hyperion, including the newly aligned Anti Entropy, set off for Arc City. There they were supposed to meet Grey Serpent, an intel dealer, for news of Kiana's whereabouts. Mei encountered Rita Rossweisse, who had taken out the dealer prior to their landing. She tried to fight her off, but had to run away, as she was too strong of an opponent. They couldn't find Kiana.\n\nAfter the events in Arc City, Dr. Einstein and Dr. Nikola Tesla (Anti Entropy leaders) informed the group that there were two options to take. One was to continue searching for Kiana, and the other was to head to the Anti Entropy base in the Pacific Ocean to retrieve the Gem of Desire. They ended up deciding to do both. Despite Mei wanting to talk to Cocolia about her kidnappings, she decided she would rather go look for Kiana. Einstein, Theresa, and Bronya would go to the base, while Tesla and Mei headed to Anti Entropy headquarters to repair the Ningyo that they found in Arc City. After completing their first task, Mei and Tesla headed back to Arc City to look for Kiana.\n\nMei found Rita, who was gathering intel in Heliopolis. With her blade to Rita's neck, she demanded to know where Kiana was located. She also took back the eye Rita cut out of Gray Serpent. This would be useful for the Ningyo's reawakening. Once she got what she wanted, she immediately rushed to Kiana.\n\nIn the basement of Heliopolis, the two reunited. Mei rushed to embrace her, but Kiana's quiet resolve shook Mei to her core. Kiana explained that she didn't want to put anyone in danger, and that she would not be leaving with her. They headed outside, where Mei got injured by Raven. Mei watched as Kiana beat Raven, but spared her life. Then, she could only watch as Kiana defused the bomb and fell from the sky. Durandal, who had caught Kiana with the powers of the Sixth Divine Key (Abyss Flower), obliterated Mei in the fight for Kiana. She burst off into the distance and Mei chased her, but to no avail. Mei, exhausted and weak, could only cling to Kiana's jacket as she watched her be taken away. Feelings of uselessness swelled in her heart as she cried.\n\nAbout three days after the incident, Mei and Tesla caught a strong Honkai signal from Nagazora. Believing it to be Kiana, they arrived as fast as they could. In the midst of their search for Kiana, they stumbled upon Sora, who led them to her home. There, Mei learned there were actually survivors in Nagazora, and that they had someone looking after them. Sora talked about that person's impact on her, and how she was given a reason to go on by her kindness. Mei reminisced in the past, opening up to Sora about Kiana's importance to her. Sora said it sounded like Kiana was like her own teacher was to her. That teacher ended up being Raven, who saved the two from Benares.\n\nFor Mei, the 4 months before she found Kiana had brought her to the realization that she hadn't changed. She was still the weak girl who couldn't do anything. She was the one who wasn't strong enough to protect her loved ones. After a confrontation with Raven, her Herrscher powers arose, despite not having the gem within her. Raven backed off, telling her to go get Kiana before she changed her mind. Mei finally found Kiana, but Honkai poisoning had worked its way all over her body: she was on the brink of death.\n\nTesla managed to successfully save her, but told Mei that Kiana only had two more months to live. Kiana's pain, and the revelation she was going to die, made Mei unable to sleep. She stayed awake until Kiana finally woke up. Mei pushed down her fears and walked into the medical bay, only to see Kiana looking up at her. Despite how happy she was to see her, Mei also scolded Kiana for running away and not even telling them where she was. Kiana tried to lighten up conversation with a compliment, but eventually apologized. Mei informed Kiana of everything that had happened these past 4 months. After a bit of chatting, Kiana said she wanted to go outside. Mei reluctantly accepted and let her go, but also made sure to come along. The two went for a walk around Nagazora, and chatted about their previous travelling through the city. They bickered back and forth, but eventually the mood became serious. Kiana told her that she was K-423, and Mei told her it didn't matter. No matter what, she and the others would stay by her side.\n\nAfterwards, Tesla and Einstein told Mei what their thoughts were on the matter: as Kiana's problem is Sirin herself, they cannot do anything to cure or prevent her death. Basically, it would be up to Kiana alone. Einstein said for now, they wanted to move her to a base and prepare for the worst. Mei asked for elaboration, and Einstein did not answer, but the silence answered for her. They would have to kill Kiana if worst came to worst. Sora arrived right afterward, wanting to say goodbye to Mei, but Mei couldn't muster up the will to smile at her. Feeling bad, she walked Sora back to the Nest, where Raven said World Serpent had a way to cure Kiana's condition, and to come back alone in two hours if she was interested.\n\nLater on, she overheard Tesla and Einstein talking to Kiana about her condition. Kiana expressed immense regret for the hurt she had caused everyone, but especially Mei. She said she took everything Mei had wanted away from her. She asked the doctors to not let her friends come near her if things went south, and that she didn't want to cause them any more grief. Mei could only shed a tear; Kiana had been putting on a mask for her.\n\nMei's despair swelled when Kiana lied to her about being able to taste the curry she made for her. The one she wanted to help would not even rely on her, so she took matters into her own hands. She met Raven at the Nest and then met Kevin Kaslana. He told her if she became the true Herrscher of Thunder, she would be able to give Kiana more time to live. He told her she would not lose herself this time. Kevin added that he has seen people like Kiana before, and that she would never stop trying to be a hero. He said the only true way to save her was by joining World Serpent and stopping the threats before Kiana could. Mei agreed to his offer.\n\nA while later, she woke up in the streets and ran into Kiana, who was covered in wounds. Kiana told Mei to head back to Helios. She stated that she wanted to use her void powers to close the portal in the sky, and Mei tried to tell her off, but Kiana said she didn't care if she died. Mei looked on in horror as Kiana summoned Benares to fly to the source of the Honkai energy, with Mei left chasing her once again. After running wildly through the city, Mei stumbled upon a wounded Benares, with a sword impaling it. Nihilus, the creature that owned said sword, proceeded to fight her. Although it took forever to defeat, and Mei was heavily injured, she won against it. Suddenly, though, it turned back time and came back. It charged at Mei, and swung its sword down onto her. Benares took the blow, and died in the process. Mei fell unconscious.\n\nThis is when she entered a place familiar to her. A void with only purple light. She knew where she was. Her Herrscher personality was surprised Mei came to her first, and asked if she was sure she wanted to become the real Herrscher of Thunder. Mei was resolved. She would save Kiana. Thus, she took up her power alone: the Conquest gem leaving Kiana and transferring into her strength. She took the remains of Benares, creating a new life and renaming it Kurikara. Mei fought Kiana when she refused to let her go with Kevin. When Kiana began to use the powers that were killing her, Mei beat her down quickly. Mei explained it wasn't right for Kiana to suffer in silence, dying for her heroism. Kiana dismissed it, saying this was simply her mission. With an exclamation of her true feelings, Mei broke the lances surrounding her and chased after Kiana. She was quick enough to catch up to her this time. She defeated her and left with World Serpent.",

She wears\nHistory\nBorn some time in the year 2000, Bronya\u2019s parents are both presumed dead, with her father's having been confirmed earlier. Somehow ending up in the hands of Russian gangs, Bronya was forced to become a sniper.\n\nPersonality\nBronya is emotionally stunted as a result of Project X-10, speaking in a deadpan tone with a matching expression. Bronya rarely shows empathy or acts in accordance with others. Despite this, she adores both the HOMU franchise and Seele, and sympathises with Wendy. When she became the Herrscher of Reason, the Core of Reason repaired both her legs and brain, allowing her to walk and feel the emotions she had lost. She has a grown-up personality, and a very logical way of thinking, although she has trouble understanding concepts based on intuition, which is what Kiana often acts upon.\n\nShe refers to herself in the third person as \"The Bronya\" and often refers to others as \"subject\", with the only exceptions being Seele and Mei. She can be quite competitive when it comes to what she is passionate about, particularly video games. While she takes pleasure in defeating an overconfident Kiana, she is seen on one occasion to purposely let Mei win.\n\nBronya is attached to Mei, seeing her as an older sister, and remarks on how Mei is one of the only people who truly accepted her. She loves Mei enough to sacrifice her life for her, as seen when she burns the bio-chip in her brain to avoid hurting Mei.\n\nBronya cares for Seele greatly, as shown when she sacrifices herself in the Sea of Quanta to allow Seele to escape. Their relationship is hinted to have romantic undertones, as Seele kisses Bronya in the Azure Waters manga. Bronya sticks to her promise to protect Seele and take her to the sea, the two being shown to deeply trust each other.\n\nManga Story\nAzure Waters\nOn a mission to kill Cocolia, all of the gang members were wiped out except Bronya. She awoke in Cocolia's Orphanage, being told that Cocolia doesn\u2019t kill kids. Bronya was quickly adopted into the family, and had a close relationship with a girl named Seele Vollerei. The two had even promised to go to the beach together.\n\nBronya showed great promise with Honkai adaptability, making a girl named Sin Mal become jealous and break Bronya\u2019s legs. However, Bronya didn\u2019t turn her in.\n\nWhen Seele was kidnapped by another Russian gang, Bronya staged a one-woman raid, and killed everyone, setting her reputation as the \u2018Silver Wolf of the Urals\u2019 in stone.\n\nBronya was going to take the X-10 test, but to protect her, Seele took it in her place. However, she disappeared, causing Bronya to demand to take it as well. During the test, Bronya briefly appeared in the quantum state where Seele was. Bronya knew this wasn't something she could return from unharmed. She wanted to stay with Seele, even if that meant her own death. Seele refused to let her do so; she told Bronya that she was strong, the strongest person in her life. Seele urged her to leave, saying she was her only hope of return. Bronya pinky-promised to look for a way to take Seele out of there, and that she\u2019d never give up. Before Bronya had to leave, Seele gave her a \u201cgift\u201d from the previous civilization \u2014 a mecha Bronya named \u201cProject Bunny\u201d that followed her every command. She kissed Bronya, saying she would have to return it when they meet again.\n\nUpon exiting the test, Bronya was in much worse condition though: due to her legs being broken and her extended amount of time in the X-10 trial, Bronya was left without the use of her legs and the destruction of her limbic system, leaving her without the ability to feel emotion. She now needed prosthetics to walk.\n\nEscape from Nagazora\nBronya was sent to capture Raiden Mei, after Cocolia unleashed her stigma in 2014.\n\nAfter joining both Mei and her traveling partner Kiana Kaslana, she ended up following them onto the Hyperion and to St. Freya Academy.\n\nSt. Freya High\nAfter arriving at St. Freya, Bronya agreed to enroll. During Kiana Kaslana\u2019s studying, Bronya assisted her with a virtual reality simulation showing Kallen Kaslana\u2019s execution. While they attempted to save her, they failed.\n\nAE Invasion\nBronya tried to stop one of the Joyce Welt clone, but was defeated after Project Bunny was destroyed.

Brave and sometimes reckless in battle, she never backs down when the lives of others are at stake. She is hardworking, as she was able become a member of the Assault Squad after grueling training despite having zero prior combat experience.\n\nShe cares deeply for Kiana Kaslana, Raiden Mei and Bronya Zaychik. She protected Mei from Schicksal HQ's influence after the 3rd Eruption and saw Kiana as a person despite knowing her status as a clone. In the end she nobly sacrificed the chance to save herself to save Kiana.\n\nHistory\nBorn in 1987 to scientist Murata Ryusuke and an unnamed mother, by age 15 she graduated high school at the top of her class and presented a paper on an international conference. Her father was busy with work in Schicksal and her mother passed away previously. Interested in exploring the stars, in 2002 she enrolled into California Institute of Technology's Aerospace and Space Engineering program, studying under teachers like Einstein and Welt Yang by age 18. She was also interested in aliens, attempting to travel to New Mexico alone to investigate an alien sighting. Welt accompanied her to lead her away from what was actually an Arahato test.\n\nHowever, tragedy would strike again in 2005. Her proximity to Welt and Ryusuke made her an unsuspecting target for the forces they were fighting against, leaving her unconscious and at deaths door. When she woke up, she found a farewell letter her father had left for her, and was informed by Einstein that her father had indeed died, while Welt had mysteriously disappeared. Wanting answers and knowing her father had worked for Schicksal, Himeko finished her PhD the next year and joined Schicksal to investigate her father's death. Despite having no special abilities and lower honkai adaptability than most valkyries because of her age, with encouragement from her future squad leader, Ragna, she underwent grueling training and was accepted into the Assault Squad at age 19, beginning her valkyrie career at an older age than most valkyries. She also received an artificial stigma to compensate for her lower adaptability, but it reduced her lifespan.\n\nIn 2010, an incident occured that led to the destruction of the Assault Squad, with Himeko being the only survivor. She joined St. Freya soon after as a teacher, inspired by Ragna's last words. The following year, she recruited Bianka Ataegina, an orphan at a Schicksal orphanage into St Freya who would later also be known as Durandal.\n\nManga Story\nEscape from Nagazora\nIn 2014, she responded to the 3rd Eruption in Nagazora, attempting to stop the possessed Mei until her herrscher personality was defeated by Kiana. She took Kiana, Mei and Bronya into St Freya after the battle. Mei, afraid that her power would cause another disaster, was reassured by Himeko who pledged to train her in controlling her power. For extra precaution, Mei had a bomb attached to her heart. This bomb would go off if Mei's powers were active for over five minutes. Himeko then became the trio's teacher and squad leader.\n\nGame Story\nIn 2016, after Kiana was kidnapped by Fu Hua and Durandal, she led the rescue mission and charged first into Schicksal's 3rd Airport. She disabled the Airport's generator to weaken its defenses with Tesla, but she was defeated by Fu Hua. Himeko and Tesla were almost killed by Rita Rossweisse, but Fu Hua intervened and they were taken prisoner in Helheim instead. While she was unconscious, Rita treated her of the injuries sustained in the previous battle. After Rita left the room, Fu Hua gave her feathers to numb the pain of her injuries, along with a vial of HSN-b46: which she could use to remove the Honkai erosion inside her and revert into a normal human.\n\nHimeko gave it to Tesla instead and it made it possible to create the God-Slaying Spear. This could potentially defeat the Herrscher of the Void. It would save Kiana by suppressing Sirin's control over Kiana's body. After Fu Hua was shot by Otto Apocalypse, Himeko's feather guided her to the location of the Vermillion Knight battlesuit, stored deep in Shicksal HQ. The suit, in theory, was meant to be used as a last resort if the Herrscher of the Void went out of control. After gaining control over the Haste Gem embedded into the Vermillion Knight suit, she fought her way out of Helheim, rescuing Hyperion and Anti-Entropy.\n\nWhile protecting Hyperion from an attack by Benares, she was pulled into the Herrscher of the Void's imaginary space. Himeko defeated HoV and saved Kiana by injecting the God-Slaying Spear into her, but she succumbed to her injuries sustained in the fight and from pushing the VK suit to its limits.

She wears a golden crown-like hair accessory with a red jewel, a black bow, a black traditional Chinese dress with one sleeve, a golden belt, red bands, a white glove, a black fingerless glove, and black and gold heels.\nPersonality\nFu Hua has a stoic, aloof, and cold personality. She is very obedient, to the point where she still followed Dr. MEI even when she was still angry at her for Captain HIMEKO's death. However, she is kind and respectful to her friends and comrades, especially to Book Of Fuxi, Fuxi, Nuwa, Su, and even Kevin Kaslana. But after the 14th Herrscher defeated MOTH and the Previous Era Survivors awoke from cryosleep, she changed. She gained split personality due to her uncountable amount of memories, she was so duty bound she forgot to sleep and eat for days, and she became even colder. After Fuxi and Nuwa's death, Hua hated the Honkai so much to the point where she created a rule that she and her disciples had to follow: \"No mercy for the corrupted. No quarter given.\" This seemingly simple rule ended up killing thousands of people and made many of Hua's disciples, such as Lin Zhaoyu, orphans. Hua also became very lonely due to the fact that she was immortal and all her friends died from old age, so she began to avoid people entirely.\n\nHistory\nHua was born in the slums during the Previous Era. Her father ran a dojo in the area, but as times changed so did people's perspectives on it. She stayed diligent to her training: running 1000 meters every morning and practicing the moves she had been taught. Even the day of a flight, she continued to keep her dedication.\n\nAs she was doing her usual jog, she ran into family friends. Different topics came up, but it almost always circled back to the dojo and the new school she was going to. It just so happened today was her last day in her hometown-- and that she was taking a flight to Sapphire to go to school.\n\nA man who knew her father told her to focus on getting a degree instead of worrying about the dojo. He also brought up that a rich man had interest in buying the dojo to replace it with a restaurant--- that this would be a good opportunity. Fu Hua said she had never heard of that-- and reluctantly went along with what he said.\n\nAfter her training, she went to visit her father in the hospital. He had apparently been attacked by what appeared to be a zombie, and was now recovering. He was awake, however, and was excited to see her. Apparently Hua was supposed to be gone for 6 months for school-- and he said he wanted to get a good look at her before she left.\n\nHer father then went on to tell her to just focus on school-- to abandon training and try to get a career that would give her an actual future. She stayed silent. He sent her off gladly, saying he hoped she would make friends. She, in contrast, was quite miserable. Hua muttered to herself she probably wouldn't make friends at all.\n\nA week into classes, she woke up early out of habit. Lamenting the fact she couldn't jog, she went back to sleep. Hua walked alone to class. She overheard a girl talking about a recent zombie attack-- but didn't know who said it. She asked around, but was met with scorn from her classmates. She finally found the student who mentioned it, but was openly mocked about her clothing. She left without asking anything. She was ostracized from her classmates.\n\nLater, she was passing by a dark alley and saw a girl being attacked by what seemed to be a zombie. Hua quickly defeated the zombie and saved the girl. They later became close friends and often hung out together. It is hinted that the girl was Hua's only friend before joining Fire Moth.\n\nPost-7th Eruption\nHIMEKO was corrupted and became the 7th Herrscher. Hua was the only survivor, which caused her to be shunned by others. Hua however, continued to fight on the front lines. But Hua was very affected by HIMEKO's death. In fact- she was infuriated.\n\nManga Story\nSecret of the God Keys\nHua appeared in Secret Of The God Keys for a brief period of time. She seemed to listen to an order Dr. MEI was giving out and fought one of the 10th Herrschers.\n\nWings of Origin\nAfter the defeat of the 10th Herrscher, Hua was sent to neutralize some Honkai Beasts in Australia at the age of 17, along with other members of her squad, all armed with 10th divine keys. As far as they knew, this mission was a \u201ctest drive\u201d for the weapons. The members of the squad were told by MOTH to inject a liquid into their bodies, which they all did. This liquid was ICHOR, Intra-Chromosomal Honkai Gene Repeats.\n\nHua\u2019s squad was all cut down by Ganesha, even though they were told there was no Emperor Honkai Beasts in the area. Hua was the only one left alive. She was struck by Ganesha, but had a flashback to her promise to HIMEKO to find her out why she turned. This promise gave her the inspiration needed to keep fighting, and Hua managed to activate the ICHOR.\n\nHua sprouts wings, and defeats Ganesha, becoming the 3rd known successful MANTIS (besides Kevin Kaslana and Su). She was also subjected to SWARA (Subliminal Weaponiziation and Artificing of Reflex Arcs), which gave her increased muscular strength and reaction time.\n\nDefeat Of The 11th Herrscher\nKevin compliments Hua for fighting very well against the 11th Herrscher. Kevin then tells Hua that Dr. MEI is moving Hua to the Far East Branch. Hua replies that she doesn't care and Kevin notices she's still angry about HIMEKO's death. Hua asks Kevin on why does he want her to understand MEI. She rants on how Dr. MEI didn't try to understand her and how she won't try to understand her back. Hua asks him if she tried to understand HIMEKO since the Captain was Kevin's friend and Hua's savior. She claims that HIMEKO talked in her normal voice but Kevin killed her. Kevin tries to blame the death on himself, but Hua immediately tells him to not affiliate himself with MEI. Hua says that she will obey but she won't try to understand Dr. MEI. Hua then adds that she should've tried to see if the soldiers wielding the 10th Divine Keys and the soldiers killed by her ICHOR mods would understand her.\n\nThey grow silent as Hua contemplates that she might have said too much. Kevin tells Hua that he will stay in the Central Base, which Hua says of course he would. But Kevin tells her that it isn't for MEI, but rather it was because they needed understanding due to the fact they are comrades and they needed a common vision. He also mentions that only 3 cities were left and the Honkai attacks were becoming worse. Although the 12th Herrscher came shortly after the 11th and was in MOTH's custody, the MANTISes needed to keep fighting and win the war at any cost. Kevin tells Hua to understand them because the future of humanity lies on their shoulders. They then arrive at an intersection where they say their goodbyes. Kevin goes up to meet with SAKURA and Hua runs to the opposite corridor, where she hears the alarm for a Herrscher. She finally tells herself that she would obey.\n\nAttack Of The 12th Herrscher\nHua fights a bunch of corrupted soldiers. She realizes that the 12th Herrscher has been awakened and sighs as she remembers that the 12th is SAKURA's sister. Hua assumes that the 12th Herrscher can create mental attacks and uses Fenghuang Down's 2nd power, Complex Manifest. Hua notices that the 12th Herrscher is able to fight Kevin, SAKURA, and herself. She creates a copy of herself to prevent the Herrscher from getting to her. After stopping the Herrscher's mental attack, Hua goes up to meet with Kevin. Kevin tells her she managed to prevent a lot of casualties, which Hua is relieved about. But then, Kevin tells her the bad news: the Herrscher hacked the computers and launched all of MOTH's nuclear missiles at the 3 remaining human cities. Hua immediately panics, saying that she forgot about the computers.\n\nGame Story\nChapter 2: Voice in the Dreams\nFu Hua is assigned to train Kiana Kaslana for the St. Freya exams. She tutors Kiana about stigma, battlesuit types, and history. She is later seen cheering Kiana on when Kiana did a \"duel\" with Rita Rossweisse. Hua checks up on Kiana after collapsing from fighting a simulated Ganesha.",

            "content": "Sirin is the Current Era's Herrscher of the Void and one of the Main Antagonists of Honkai Impact 3's main story line.\n\n\nContents\n1\tAppearance\n2\tPersonality\n3\tHistory\n4\tManga Story\n4.1\tPost-2nd Eruption War\n4.2\tAE Invasion\n5\tGame Story\n5.1\tArc City\n5.2\tNorth Africa and Nagazora\n6\tTrivia\nAppearance\nSirin appears as a young girl somewhere between the ages of 12 and 13. She has long purple hair and yellow eyes.\n\nHer outfit changed 3 times during the course of the 2nd Eruption. She is first seen wearing a white lab gown before her full awakening.\n\nAfter her full awakening, her outfit changed into a short tube dress. It was mostly white and purple; with reddish purple lines and small golden decorations on the front. She also wore a purple hair clip with red inlays, purple gloves with the same reddish purple color on her palms, and a purple choker with a yellow ornament. Both her arms and legs were wrapped in purple bandages.\n\nAfter her Ascension on the Moon, her dress changed dramatically and her pupils are replaced with yellow crosses.\n\nPersonality\nOriginally Sirin was a kind and caring girl, thinking of everyone as a friend. However, with the experiments in Babylon Tower killing all of her friends, she grew a complex for power and revenge, refusing to die, and suffering the abuse, she made the resolve to kill everyone in Schicksal.\n\nAfter her partial awakening, she exacted her revenge on the 322 scientists of Babylon Labs. Her heart was filled with a deep hatred for Schicksal and its valkyries, and was so exacted on the idea that they were all liars that she would not listen to Theresa's words.\n\nWhen she fully awoke as a Herrscher, her personality took a drastic turn. She became prideful, overconfident and arrogant: deeming humans as nothing but insects and believing herself to be the God's chosen one. She looked down on those less powerful than her. Even \"Bella\" was shocked to see what her best friend had become. However, deep down Sirin was still a young girl who needed someone she could believe in, despite not being able to believe in anyone at all. And so, she had an attachment to Cecilia that affected Kiana. It seems that in 2014, Sirin's personality is still this way.\n\nIn Sirin's return in 2016, her personality had changed again. Sirin had matured, and was much more calm and composed, and regal. Despite her calm appearance, Sirin still has a seething, raging, anger for humanity underneath. She enjoyed seeing humanity suffer, and using words to mentally weaken Kiana. She is still prideful and self centered, seeing even the Herrscher of Domination as nothing but a toy to let her take control once again.\n\nIt is also constantly hinted that Sirin is afraid of Siegfried after he crushed Sirin's forces, cut her arm off, and removed the Gem of Serenity: her source of regeneration.\n\nHistory\nSirin grew up in a small village in Belarus with her mother. Nothing is known about her other family members, if she had any.\n\nAt some point before the 2nd Eruption, Sirin's mother died from Honkai Radiation and she was taken in by Schicksal to be a test subject at Babylon Labs for their Stigmata Research. In these tests, she and her friends would be subject to being injected with Honkai Energy. The Scientists eventually discovered that Sirin had remarkably high Honkai Resistance and demonstrated the ability to absorb and neutralize Honkai Energy within her body. They hadn't been able to determine how she was able to do this, but believed it was very much what they were looking for.\n\nManga Story\nIn the year 2000, Sirin amassed enough power to massacre the 322 scientists in Babylon Labs; after which she began to absorb energy from the Reactor.\n\nThis prompted Otto Apocalypse to send an investigation team to Babylon Labs consisting of Theresa Apocalypse and Patricia Highsmith. There, Sirin was confronted by Patricia and Sirin defeated her. Teleporting away from Babylon Labs, Sirin was taken to a \"Honkai Chrysalis\".\n\nAfter entering, she formed her Core and fully awoke as the 2nd Herrscher: the Herrscher of the Void.\n\nEventually she was found by Theresa, and Sirin showed her a flashback of her past in an attempt to recruit her to her cause. Failing to recruit Theresa, Sirin reserved herself to eliminating her. After defeating her she was confronted by the Herrscher of Reason (the 1st Herrscher), Welt Yang.\n\nIn their battle Sirin overpowered Welt, but Lieserl Albert Einstein (his ally) launched the Silver Bullet her way. Sirin didn't know what it was, but she knew it was dangerous, so she redirected it into the ground. Despite this, the resulting explosion was enough to stun her. She fell down to the ground below. Using his false Star of Eden, Welt created a Quasi-Blackhole to suck Sirin in to try and defeat her. He was then thwarted by a masked Clown.\n\nBenares carried Sirin to the moon with the last of its strength, and Sirin used a large portion of her power heal it. She also gave it a pseudo-Herrscher Core. This gave Benares the ability to take on a human form, which Sirin named Bella (the same name as her best friend). Soon after, the Will of the Honkai pointed Sirin to the ruins on the moon.\n\nDeep within these ruins, Sirin came face to face with \"God\".\n\nSirin was given a massive amount of information about the Previous Era and told about the Honkai's eternal crusade to eliminate humanity. The Will of the Honkai then gave Sirin four Gems: the Gems of Conquest, Desire, Haste and Serenity. These Gems were portions of the next four Herrschers' abilities. In receiving them, she gained much more strength.\n\nTo test her new found power, she flung some pillars from the temple onto the Earth. This caused massive destruction, killing millions.\n\nWelt and Siegfried Kaslana launched themselves to the moon with the Arahato, where Welt engaged Sirin in battle again. Sirin stole Welt's Core from him and absorbed it into her body.\n\nSirin went back down to Earth and onto Siberia. Once she descended, she sent her Seraphim Princes, (each controlling Fire, Wind and Death in accordance with the Gems) to wreak havoc and destruction in Finland, Kazakhstan, and Russia (SFSR). Each of her minions was soundly defeated which frustrated Sirin greatly. Bella had moved to engage Siegfried's formation while Otto Apocalypse, Fu Hua and Cheng Lixue engaged Sirin in combat.\n\nSirin fell into Fu Hua's illusion and was beaten there, allowing Otto to use his copy of Fenghuang Down to trick Sirin into resurrecting her dead mother. The outcome was not what Otto sought, since Sirin used the power of the Gem of Serenity to take DNA from her Mother's apron, but also used the Core of Reason to re-create her mother's body instead of the Gem. Her mother was a soulless puppet and nothing more.\n\nIn his frustration he had Sirin ask \"God\" what the meaning of a soul is. After asking his question, Otto was invited to meet with \"God\" and Sirin was freed from the illusion. Sirin engaged with Lixue in combat once she was out of it. Lixue faced her alone to buy time for Otto and Fu Hua to escape (since Otto could no longer use the Void Archives to trick her). Lixue was defeated, and Sirin corrupted a feather that Otto left behind from his copied Fenghuang Down. Sirin didn't waste any time testing out the feather, and set her sights on Cecilia and Siegfried. The two were leading the formations responsible for holding back her swarms of Honkai Beasts, and their fall would help her chances greatly.\n\nSirin wished to create a nightmarish world where Siegfried and Cecilia would suffer and eventually break, but instead the dream world showed Siegfried and Cecilia living as a happy family preparing for their daughter, Kiana Kaslana's, birthday. Her frustration finally reached it's peak when she saw them celebrating. She ended up joining them in the dream world with the intention of destroying their happiness.\n\nBut she stopped when Cecilia told Siegfried off for not recognizing their \"daughter\" Sirin. She was invited inside and Cecilia gave her a slice of cake. Sirin took a bite and began crying: reminded of her dead mother and cake she would buy for her.\n\nAfter going up to her room in the illusion, Cecilia joined Sirin and embraced her until she fell asleep.\n\nOn the next day, Sirin went shopping with Cecilia and Siegfried at the mall until Welt's interruption caused a large set of windows to burst near her. Cecilia jumped in front of Sirin to save her and suffered a cut on her cheek. She told her \"the magic words\": Ich liebe dich (I love you).\n\nLater that evening Sirin was trying to figure out why Cecilia would jump to save her. The confusion from the most recent events began sewing doubt in her mind, but soon the Bella doll she was hugging disappeared as a result of Bella's Core being destroyed by Shub-Niggurath. This was thanks to a crack on her carapace left by the Judgement of Shamash in an earlier battle with Siegfried.\n\nLosing her temper, Sirin ran Siegfried through with a Subspace Lance and was about to finish him with a second when Cecilia got him out of the way. Sirin, realizing that Cecilia knew that it was an illusion all along, flew into a rage, which allowed Welt to jump in and save the two.\n\nMeanwhile, the Arahato had gotten into position to activate the Selene. Einstein activated it, which disrupted Sirin's Honkai energy enough to allow Siegfried and Cecilia to escape the illusion. They were reunited with Theresa in the real world.\n\nWelt initiated his rematch against Sirin to stall for time, allowing Einstein a chance to try to neutralize the Honkai energy within Sirin. The Selene failed to do that, but Einstein was able to see the different Cores.\n\nShe began her operation to extract a Core from Sirin, and got the Gem of Conquest out. She threw it to Tesla via the Arahato's right arm. She was about to attempt a second extraction when Sirin awoke. In her rage she trashed the Arahato and crushed the Core of Reason.\n\nSirin was caught by a plant sprouted by the Abyss Flower, which prevented her from killing Einstein. Siegfried, Cecilia and Theresa now confronted her. Sirin's rage skyrocketed before she locked Siegfried and Cecilia into an Infinite Corridor, leaving Theresa to face Sirin on her own. Theresa activated the Oath of Judah's Zeroth Power to completely nullify Sirin's Honkai energy, and she reverted to being a powerless little girl within the field.\n\nThe field had affected Theresa's aim, so when she threw her spear, it landed in Sirin's right leg instead of her heart. The pain made Sirin remember the experiments, but a vision of Bella reminded her about her Cores and brought her back to her senses. Eventually Theresa closed the gap between them and stabbed Sirin in the heart. After Theresa removed the spear from Sirin, the Gem of Serenity revived her by repairing the damage.\n\nJust as Sirin was about to deal the final blow to Theresa, Siegfried came bursting out of the Infinite Corridor cube because his MANTIS genes were activated, forcing him into a berserk state. Despite her best efforts, Sirin was easily defeated by Siegfried, her left arm being cut in the process. The berserk Siegfried ripped the Gem of Serenity out of Sirin as well as the other Infinite Corridor box that trapped Cecilia.\n\nShortly after, as Sirin's consciousness sank into the abyss, she came to the realization that she was alone and that she would die alone.\n\nAlmost as if in response to her realization, the damage that Sirin's Core received took its toll, and it cracked. The resulting crack caused her Core to begin Cascading, bathing Siberia in pure, toxic Honkai radiation that killed everything living thing it touched.\n\nBecause Sirin no longer had control of her powers, the Infinite Corridor that held Cecilia collapsed and allowed her to escape. After tending to Siegfried and devising a plan, Cecilia moved to a vantage point. She commanded the Abyss Flower to take all of her Schariac blood and form a spear that would completely halt the abundance of Honkai energy erupting from Sirin's Core as well as cleanse Siberia of the radiation, healing those that were corrupted.\n\nSiegfried dealt the finishing blow by charging the Judgment of Shamash (using the residual Honkai energy) and activating the Might of An-Utu. With a mighty swing he slammed the Might of An-Utu into the ground, causing a tremendous explosion and effectively nuking Sirin, completely halting the Core Cascade and nullifying her power.\n\nCecilia, now drained of her blood, went over to Siegfried and said goodbye to him, ordering the Abyss Flower to protect him because Otto had ordered Honkai fission missiles to be launched where Siegfried and Sirin were. Just as Sirin fell from the sky, Cecilia caught her, and the two of them spent their last moments alive together.\n\nSeveral years later, Otto Apocalypse used Kiana's DNA to create clones in the hope of resurrecting the Herrscher of the Void in a suitable vessel. His plan was to control her afterwards. The clones from K-420 to K-422 had failed, and K-423, who had the Core of the Void implanted during her growth, had yet to gain awareness.\n\nOtto was about to scrap the clone, but Sirin made a wish to start over as Cecilia's daughter, and clone K-423 gained awareness shortly afterward. The implications of this have not been touched upon.\n\nPost-2nd Eruption War\nIn 2010, when Siegfried kept K-423 at a cabin, Sirin awoke and was promptly put down again by Siegfried before she could cause anyone harm.\n\nAE Invasion\nSirin's underlying fears affected Kiana's training simulations, where Siegfried appeared as her biggest fear.\n\nGame Story\nIn the main story Sirin haunts K-423's dreams, causing her to have nightmares. After the Wendy arc, Kiana, in an attempt to help Bronya Zaychik, tried to follow Theresa as she entered the data archives. But instead of joining Theresa in the actual archives, Kiana was instead sent into an illusion created by Sirin of the 2nd Eruption war. This illusion was a distorted view of the 2nd Eruption with some major events changed.\n\nParticularly, in this version, Cecilia was defeated by Sirin instead. Before Sirin was about to kill Cecilia in the illusion, Kiana stepped in and stopped her. After failing once, Kiana was able to go back and try again. This time, the two were able to defeat Sirin together. They celebrated their victory, but the illusion faded away.\n\nAfter Kiana returns to the real world, she is confronted by Fu Hua: who had come to kidnap her and take her to Schicksal HQ under Otto's orders. Angered by Fu Hua's insistence of that victory being an illusion, she tried to fight her, but lost.\n\nIn Chapter 8, Otto uses the Gem of Serenity to reawaken Sirin from her slumber. Her hatred from 16 years ago had only grown, and she resumed what she started in the 2nd Eruption. She summoned massive swarms of Honkai beasts around the world: causing wide spread destruction. She stole the Gem of Conquest from Raiden Mei, and Mei lost most of her Herrscher power as a result.\n\nThe resulting damage caused Mei to be in critical condition. She needed emergency surgery aboard the Hyperion to survive. Murata Himeko had stolen the Vermilion Knight: Eclipse battlesuit in order to defeat Sirin and return Kiana to normal. Bringing along the anti-Honkai serum made by Tesla, she headed to the Hyperion to confront Sirin.\n\nBenares (who had been awoken once more) had begun its attack on the Hyperion when Himeko knocked it out with a single kick. Before she could deal the killing blow with her sword, Sirin brought Himeko into her personal pocket dimension. Sirin and Himeko clashed in the pocket dimension which resulted in Himeko's victory, as she succeeded in injecting the anti-Honkai serum into Kiana's body.\n\nThe injection forced Sirin's consciousness to relinquish control of Kiana's body and sleep. Sirin's pocket dimension collapses, with Kiana falling into the ocean and Himeko into the Imaginary Space. Kiana washed up on the shore some time later, and Himeko has been missing ever since.\n\nArc City\nIn Arc City, Kiana had begun fighting Sirin in her mind. Sirin's taunts began to take a toll as she eventually learned the truth of her existence and what she was originally made for: that she was not the original Kiana Kaslana, but rather the clone K-423 who was made for the sole purpose of being a vessel for the 2nd Herrscher. Sirin had almost won, and Kiana was about to commit suicide with her pistol, but Fu Hua stopped her.\n\nThe resulting struggle came to an end when Kiana saw an illusion of Himeko walking past her, which gave her some courage. It was enough to suppress Sirin and grab some power from the Core of the Void.\n\nShe used this newfound strength to protect the citizens of Arc City.\n\nNorth Africa and Nagazora\nAfter Kiana stopped the huge Honkai bomb, the massive amount of energy that she absorbed ended up buffing Sirin somewhat. She began to use the Gem of Conquest, Core of the Void, and Gem of Serenity to corrupt Kiana's body. This was a slow process that would end up in Kiana's death and Sirin's victory. The corruption and influence on Kiana's mind was apparent after Durandal had taken her to Schicksal's North African base: where they were testing the 2nd Divine Key.\n\nKevin Kaslana had attacked the North African base, allowing Kiana to escape. Although originally confronted by Kevin, Fu Hua stopped him long enough for Kiana to warp away. In her exhaustion, she teleported to Nagazora.\n\nKiana had decided to try to fight the corruption on her own, but nearly succumbed to it. Mei had found her just in time for Tesla to give her emergency treatment. During the treatment, Tesla remarked that Sirin had fought back several times, restarting the corruption just as it was removed.\n\nLater, the influence that Sirin had on Kiana can be seen in the way Kiana felt a connection to Benares despite not having seen it before. She described that she felt \"warm\" in its presence and healing it made her happy.\n\nThe beginning of the destruction\nIn Houkai world, on the Siberian snowfields, stands the second-largest Houkai-energy Research Facility: the Babylon Laboratory. The Babylon laboratory has the world's third-largest Houkai-capacity Reactor, with a power of up to 6500HW.\n\nThe Houkai power of the 4th Herrscher was only 2000HW. Such a high-intensity Houkai power can be gathered without Houkai, thanks to extremely tight isolation facilities.\n\nThere are three departments in Babylon's laboratory, the only one which is mentioned is the Advanced System Division, which disguises itself as a medical institution for the treatment of Honkai energy diseases. However, in reality, it studies the technology that combines Houkai energy with the human body. It experiments on orphaned children and said by Sirin to have abused them.\n\nAvrora Agata Bella result\nAvrora, Agata and Bella's dead bodies from the experiments\n\nSirin experiment\nThe experiment being held on Sirin\n\nAs one of countless experimental subjects, Sirin was injected with a large amount of Houkai energy by Schicksal researchers, which finally condensed a Herrscher gem in her body.\n\nWith the Houkai's agitation of negative emotions, Sirin became extremely hostile to Schicksal, manipulated the Houkai energy, and caused the disappearance of researchers in Babylon Tower\n\nAfter discovered the mysterious disappearance of researchers, Schicksal sent S-Rank Valkyrja Theresa and the Snow Wolf team to investigate. At the same time, the Anti-Entropy leader also sent Tesla and Einstein to Siberia to investigate.\n\nAfter defeating the Valkyrja who saw her true identity, the darkness in Sirin's heart became more and more inflated. At the same time, the disappearance of Snow Wolf also speeded up the search of the Schicksal Organization. In order to gain more power, Sirin first manipulated the Houkai beasts and let them divert their attention for themselves.\n\nHowever, the hordes of Houkai beasts, on the contrary, only hold Schicksal and Anti-Entropy temporarily, then they all the way to the tower. Sirin consumed almost all of the Houkai energy to launch the space ability, and transferred to the location of the Imperial-level Houkai beast - Assaka that was being bred.\n\nHere, the Herrscher consciousness completely torn Sirin's original personality, completely occupying Sirin's body. At this point, the Second Herrscher: Sirin, the Herrscher of the Void, was completely born.",
